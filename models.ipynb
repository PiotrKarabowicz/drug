CGP was performed on hybridization-captured, adaptor ligation-based libraries to a mean coverage depth of 688X for all coding exons of 236 cancer-related genes plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer, using process-matched normal control samples as a reference. CRGAs were defined as GAs linked to drugs on the market or currently under evaluation in mechanism-driven clinical trials.\\nAll 295 patients assessed were classified with high-grade (International Society of Urological Pathology classification) and advanced stage (stage III/IV American Joint Committee on Cancer) disease, and 294 of 295 patients (99.7%) had at least 1 GA on CGP with a mean of 6.4 GAs per UC (61% substitutions/insertions/deletions, 37% copy number alterations, and 2% fusions). Furthermore, 275 patients (93%) had at least 1 CRGA involving 75 individual genes with a mean of 2.6 CRGAs per UC. The most common CRGAs involved cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) (34%), fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) (21%), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) (20%), and ERBB2 (17%). FGFR3 GAs were diverse types and included 10% fusions. ERBB2 GAs were equally divided between amplifications and substitutions. ERBB2 substitutions were predominantly within the extracellular domain and were highly enriched in patients with micropapillary UC (38% of 32 cases vs 5% of 263 nonmicropapillary UC cases; P<.0001).\\nUsing a CGP assay capable of detecting all classes of GA simultaneously, an extraordinarily high frequency of CRGA was identified in a large series of patients with advanced UC.

Use of AA and AA‑containing plants causes chronic kidney disease (CKD) and upper urinary tract carcinoma (UUC); however, the underlying mechanism remains to be defined. miRNAs regulate a number of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation and metabolism. This study explored differentially expressed miRNAs between AA‑induced upper urothelial tract cancer (AAN‑UUC) and non‑AAN‑UUC tissues. Patients with AAN‑UUC and non‑AAN‑UUC (n=20/group) were recruited in the present study. Five tissue samples from each group were used for miRNA microarray profiling and the rest of the tissue samples were subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis including seven selected miRNAs for confirmation. A total of 29 miRNAs were differentially expressed between AAN‑UUC and non‑AAN‑UUC tissues (P<0.05). TargenScan and Gene ontology analyses predicted the functions and targeted genes of these differentially expressed miRNAs, i.e. Akt3, FGFR3, PSEN1, VEGFa and AR. Subsequently, expression of the selected differentially expressed miRNAs (Hsa‑miR‑4795‑5p, Hsa‑miR‑488, Hsa‑miR‑4784, Hsa‑miR‑330, Hsa‑miR‑3916, Hsa‑miR‑4274 and Hsa‑miR‑181c) was validated in another set of tissue samples. A total of 29 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between AAN‑UUC and non‑AAN‑UUC tissues and these miRNA target genes in FGFR3 and Akt pathways, which regulate cell growth and tumor progression, respectively.',\n 'To assess the diagnostic and prognostic performance of a noninvasive FGFR3 mutation analysis. After transurethral resection (TUR) of noninvasive bladder transitional cell carcinoma (B-TCC), recurrence occurs in 70% of patients, thus justifying cystoscopic surveillance.\\nA prospective multicenter study was carried out with a 2-year follow-up of patients with superficial B-TCC. Urine samples were collected before TUR and then before each cystoscopy during follow-up. Screening for the most prevalent FGFR3 mutations was done using urinary cells. The prognostic significance of an FGFR3 mutation at the time of the initial diagnosis was determined. The performance of the test in diagnosing and/or predicting recurrence during follow-up was assessed by calculating sensitivity and specificity.\\nOf 191 patients studied, 74 (39%) had a positive analysis before TUR (FGFR3 mutation group). The presence of an FGFR3 mutation at the time of diagnosis was associated with a shorter time to recurrence (P\\xa0=\\xa0.02). During follow-up, 68 patients from the FGFR3 mutation group were evaluated. FGFR3 mutation analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.87 when compared with the results of cystoscopy. A positive urine test was predictive of recurrence either at the time of the positive result or later during the 2-year follow-up, with a sensitivity of 0.70 and a specificity of 0.87.\\nAmong patients with an FGFR3 mutation in the initial tumor, a noninvasive urine test during follow-up can be valuable in diagnosing or predicting subsequent recurrence.',\n 'Inverted papilloma (IP) of the urinary tract is classified by the World Health Organisation as a non-invasive urothelial tumour with normal to minimal cytological atypia of the neoplastic cells. During the 1980s, it came under suspicion of having a premalignant or malignant potential and of being concurrent with urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC). This quandary has been proven difficult to solve, due to the fact that IP is very rare and literature mostly consists of case reports with varying levels of information, making strong meta-analyses problematic. New immunohistochemical techniques and genetic approaches are more frequently being used in the attempt to achieve better classifications, prognosis and treatment of lesions hereunder IP. This review will, in our awareness, be the first to combine the knowledge from retrospective studies with these new approaches for determining a possible premalignant potential and concurrency with UCC and subsequently outline a recommendation for follow-up. ',\n 'Urothelial bladder cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease. Cancer cell lines are useful tools for its study. This is a comprehensive genomic characterization of 40 urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) cell lines including information on origin, mutation status of genes implicated in bladder cancer (FGFR3, PIK3CA, TP53, and RAS), copy number alterations assessed using high density SNP arrays, uniparental disomy (UPD) events, and gene expression.\\nBased on gene mutation patterns and genomic changes we identify lines representative of the FGFR3-driven tumor pathway and of the TP53/RB tumor suppressor-driven pathway. High-density array copy number analysis identified significant focal gains (1q32, 5p13.1-12, 7q11, and 7q33) and losses (i.e. 6p22.1) in regions altered in tumors but not previously described as affected in bladder cell lines. We also identify new evidence for frequent regions of UPD, often coinciding with regions reported to be lost in tumors. Previously undescribed chromosome X losses found in UBC lines also point to potential tumor suppressor genes. Cell lines representative of the FGFR3-driven pathway showed a lower number of UPD events.\\nOverall, there is a predominance of more aggressive tumor subtypes among the cell lines. We provide a cell line classification that establishes their relatedness to the major molecularly-defined bladder tumor subtypes. The compiled information should serve as a useful reference to the bladder cancer research community and should help to select cell lines appropriate for the functional analysis of bladder cancer genes, for example those being identified through massive parallel sequencing.',\n 'Mutations in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes constitute the most recurrent somatic alterations in urothelial carcinoma of bladder. In this study, we screened DNA from 327 urothelial bladder carcinomas from well-documented patients, with different stages and grades and known TERT promoter mutational status, for FGFR3 alterations and measured relative telomere length (RTL). Although, the frequency of the TERT promoter mutations was higher than those in FGFR3; however, the alterations at the two loci occurred together more frequently than per chance [Odds ratio (OR)\\u2009=\\u20094.93, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20092.72-8.92, p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001]. While tumors with TERT promoter and FGFR3 mutations had shorter RTL than those without mutations (p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001), the TERT promoter mutations in conjunction with the common allele of the rs2853669 polymorphism defined sub-group of patients with an observed decreased overall survival (OR\\u2009=\\u20092.15, 95% CI\\u2009=\\u20091.00-4.61) and increased recurrence in patients with TaG1+TaG2 disease categories (OR\\u2009=\\u20093.68, 95%CI\\u2009=\\u20091.12-12.05). The finding of shorter telomeres in tumors with TERT promoter and/or FGFR3 mutations than without mutations implies mechanistic relevance of telomere biology in cancer progression. The observed association with recurrence and survival shows that the TERT promoter mutations can potentially be used as markers to refine selection of patients for different treatments. The overwhelming frequency of the TERT promoter mutations also represents a case for development of an eventual therapeutic target. ',\n 'The aim of this study was to demonstrate the clinicopathological features, prognostic outcomes and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) protein expression status of a large series (n = 45) of urothelial carcinoma of bladder patients aged 30 or younger, retrospectively. We identified an age gradient (an age of 25, 26 and 27 years), classified patients as ≤ 25 or >25, ≤ 26 or >26, ≤ 27 or >27 years, respectively, and compared variables including recurrence events and FGFR3 expression patterns between different groups. Patients aged 25 years or younger were less likely to experience tumor recurrence (p = 0.046), were more likely to develop smaller size tumors (p = 0.040) and expressed more proportion of negative pattern of FGFR3 protein (p = 0.036). Patients aged 25 years or younger were less likely to develop tumor recurrence and revealed more proportion of negative pattern of FGFR3 expression than those aged 26-30 years did. We identified patients aged 25 years or younger as the true \"young\" urothelial carcinoma patients, carrying distinct clinical outcomes and molecular tumorigenesis.',\n None,\n 'The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) has been recently shown to be dysregulated, which plays an important role in the progression of several cancers. However, the biological role and clinical significance of UCA1 in the carcinogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Herein, we found that UCA1 was aberrantly upregulated in HCC tissues and associated with TNM stage, metastasis and postoperative survival. UCA1 depletion inhibited the growth and metastasis of HCC cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, UCA1 could act as an endogenous sponge by directly binding to miR-216b and downregulation miR-216b expression. In addition, UCA1 could reverse the inhibitory effect of miR-216b on the growth and metastasis of HCC cells, which might be involved in the derepression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, a target gene of miR-216b, and the activation of ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, our data highlights the pivotal role of UCA1 in the tumorigenesis of HCC. Moreover, the present study elucidates a novel lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network that is UCA1-miR-216b-FGFR1-ERK signaling pathway in HCC, which may help to lead a better understanding the pathogenesis of HCC and probe the feasibility of lncRNA-directed diagnosis and therapy for this deadly disease.',\n 'Urinary bladder tumors are mainly of urothelial type. Classifications include stage and grade to provide with the required prognostic factors and help to select the most adequate treatment. Though somatic mutations in bladder tumors are known, their used for targeted therapy are restricted to clinical trials. Upper urinary tract tumors are classified as urinary bladder tumor at histological level, but tumor staging is specified according to calyx, renal pelvis or ureter location; in young patients with upper urinary tract tumor, a Lynch syndrome should be eliminated.',\n 'The TERT promoter and FGFR3 gene mutations are two of the most common genetic events in urothelial bladder cancer (UBC), and these mutation assays in patient urine have been shown to be promising biomarkers for UBC diagnosis and surveillance. These results were obtained mainly from studies of patients with UBC in Western countries, and little is known about such information in Han Chinese patients with UBC. In the present study, we addressed this issue by analyzing tumors from 182 Han Chinese patients with UBC and urine samples from 102 patients for mutations in the TERT promoter and FGFR3 and TERT mRNA expression in tumors and/or urine. TERT promoter and FGFR3 mutations were identified in 87 of 182 (47.8%) and 7 of 102 (6.7%) UBC cases, respectively. In 46 urine samples from patients with TERT promoter mutation-carrying tumors, the mutant promoter was detected in 24 (52%) prior to operation and disappeared in most examined urine samples (80%) taken 1 week after operation. TERT mRNA was detected in urine derived from 46 of 49 patients (94%) that was analyzed before operation independently of the presence of TERT promoter mutations. Collectively, FGFR3 mutations occur at a very low rate in Han Chinese UBC and cannot serve as diagnostic markers for Chinese patients. Han Chinese patients with UBC have relatively low TERT promoter mutation frequency compared with patients in Western countries, and simultaneous detection of both mutant TERT promoter and TERT mRNA improves sensitivity and specificity of urine-based diagnosis. ',\n 'Treatment of muscle invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma (BCa) remains a major challenge. Comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors and identification of driver mutations may reveal new therapeutic targets. This manuscript discusses relevant molecular drivers of the malignant phenotype and agents with therapeutic potential in BCa. Small molecule pan-FGFR inhibitors have shown encouraging efficacy and safety results especially among patients with activating FGFR mutations or translocations. mTOR inhibitors for patients with TSC1 mutations and concomitant targeting of PI3K and MEK represent strategies to block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Encouraging preclinical results with ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) exemplifies a new potential treatment for HER2-positive BCa along with innovative bispecific antibodies. Inhibitors of cell cycle regulators (aurora kinase, polo-like kinase 1, and cyclin-dependent kinase 4) are being investigated in combination with chemotherapy. Early results of clinical studies with anti-CTLA4 and anti-PDL1 are propelling immune modulating drugs to the forefront of emerging treatments for BCa. Collectively, these novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies hold promise to improve the outcome of patients afflicted with this malignancy. ',\n 'Tenascin-C is a large, multimodular, extracellular matrix glycoprotein that exhibits a very restricted pattern of expression but an enormously diverse range of functions. Here, we discuss the importance of deciphering the expression pattern of, and effects mediated by, different forms of this molecule in order to fully understand tenascin-C biology. We focus on both post transcriptional and post translational events such as splicing, glycosylation, assembly into a 3D matrix and proteolytic cleavage, highlighting how these modifications are key to defining tenascin-C function.',\n 'Second-line treatment options for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC) are limited. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is dysregulated in UC by activating mutations or protein overexpression in non-mutant tumours. In this study, the efficacy, pharmacodynamics and safety of dovitinib-a broad-targeted inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, including FGFR3-were evaluated in patients with previously treated advanced UC with and without FGFR3 mutations.\\nForty-four adults with advanced UC who had progressed after one to three platinum-based and/or combination chemotherapy regimens were classified as having mutant (FGFR3(MUT); n=12), wild-type (FGFR3(WT); n=31), or unknown (n=1) FGFR3 status. Patients received 500 mg dovitinib once daily on a 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule. The primary end-point of this two-stage study was the investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR).\\nMost of the patients were men (75%) and over half of the patients were aged ⩾65 years (61%). All patients had received ⩾1 prior antineoplastic therapy for UC. The study was terminated at the end of stage 1, when it was determined by investigator review that the ORR of both the FGFR3(MUT) (0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0-26.5) and FGFR3(WT) (3.2%; 95% CI, 0.1-16.7) groups did not meet the criteria to continue to stage 2. The most common grade 3/4 adverse events, suspected to be study-drug related, included thrombocytopenia (9%), fatigue (9%), and asthenia (9%).\\nAlthough generally well tolerated, dovitinib has very limited single-agent activity in patients with previously treated advanced UC, regardless of FGFR3 mutation status. clinicaltrials.gov NCT00790426.',\n 'Currently, the use of two classification systems for bladder cancer grade is advocated in clinical guidelines because the WHO2004 classification has not been sufficiently validated with biological markers and follow-up. The slides of 325 primary non-muscle invasive bladder cancers from three hospitals were reviewed by one uro-pathologist in two separate sessions for the WHO1973 (G1, G2 and G3) and 2004 (papillary urothelial neoplasm of low malignant potential (LMP), low-grade (LG) and high-grade (HG)) classifications. FGFR3 status was examined with PCR-SNaPshot analysis. Expression of Ki-67, P53 and P27 was analyzed by immuno-histochemistry. Clinical recurrence and progression were determined. We performed validation and cross-validation of the two systems for grade with molecular markers and clinical outcome. Multivariable analyses were done to predict prognosis and pT1 bladder cancer. Grade review resulted in 88 G1, 149 G2 and 88 G3 lesions (WHO1973) and 79 LMP, 101 LG and 145 HG lesions (WHO2004). Molecular validation of both grading systems showed that FGFR3 mutations were associated with lower grades whereas altered expression (Ki-67, P53 and P27) was found in higher grades. Clinical validation showed that the two classification systems were both significant predictors for progression but not for recurrence. Cross-validation of both WHO systems showed a significant stepwise increase in biological (molecular markers) and clinical (progression) potential along the line: G1-LG-G2-HG-G3. The LMP and G1 categories had a similar clinical and molecular profile. On the basis of molecular biology and multivariable clinical data, our results support a four-tiered grading system using the 1973 and 2004 WHO classifications with one low-grade (LMP/LG/G1) category that includes LMP, two intermediate grade (LG/G2 and HG/G2) categories and one high-grade (HG/G3) category. ',\n 'Inactivation of the NOTCH pathway drives bladder tumorigenesis. ',\n 'Compared to other members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, only few studies investigate FGFR3 in tumour angiogenesis. We investigated the connection between angiogenesis and FGF/FGFR expression including FGFR3 mutation status in urothelial carcinomas. Immunohistochemistry was performed in invasive and non-invasive urothelial cancers of 61 patients. Protein expression of CD31, factor VIII (FVIII), FGF-1/2, FGFR1, FGFR3 and FGFR4 and FGFR3 mutation status were evaluated. Morphometric assessment of angiogenesis including microvessel count (MVC) and vascular surface area (VSA) was analysed. Correlation and survival analyses (overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)) with univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. CD31 values (MVC and VSA) significantly correlated with OS and DFS. OS and DFS were significantly better in patients with FGFR3 overexpression. Multivariate analysis revealed FGFR3 protein expression and tumour grading (WHO classification 2004) as independent prognostic factors of OS and VSA of CD31 and FGFR3 protein expression of DFS. FGFR3 mutation status was correlated with VSA measured by FVIII. FGFR3 may be able to induce a pro-angiogenic phenotype in urothelial carcinomas and significantly influence prognosis. Consequently, FGFR3 is a potential therapeutic target also from the angiogenesis perspective.',\n 'Bladder cancer (BC) is the third and fifth cancer in men in terms of incidence and mortality in the US. Overexpression and mutations of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) are frequently found in BC and can represent a very interesting therapeutic target. Different FGFR3-targeted strategies have been investigated through in vitro and in vivo settings, including FGFR3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dovitinib .\\nThe authors review the data that provide a scientific rationale for FGFR3-targeted therapy in BC. They also provide an evaluation of the currently available in vitro and in vivo data on the use of dovitinib in BC patients.\\nThe development and progression of BC rely on a very complex signaling network that involves many different receptors aside from FGFR3 and VEGFR2. The involved signaling network can also be very different from one BC to the other, and can also evolve through time in the same patient. Inhibiting only one single target may thus not be sufficient to achieve a complete downstream oncogenic signaling blockage. Additionally, in vitro data on the use of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting FGFR3 show that it can be a more efficient strategy to reach the same goal, with the potential advantage of less toxicity.',\n 'The Notch signaling pathway controls cell fates through interactions between neighboring cells by positively or negatively affecting the processes of proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in a context-dependent manner. This pathway has been implicated in human cancer as both an oncogene and a tumor suppressor. Here we report new inactivating mutations in Notch pathway components in over 40% of human bladder cancers examined. Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the male population of the United States. Thus far, driver mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and, less commonly, in RAS proteins have been identified. We show that Notch activation in bladder cancer cells suppresses proliferation both in vitro and in vivo by directly upregulating dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs), thus reducing the phosphorylation of ERK1 and ERK2 (ERK1/2). In mouse models, genetic inactivation of Notch signaling leads to Erk1/2 phosphorylation, resulting in tumorigenesis in the urinary tract. Collectively our findings show that loss of Notch activity is a driving event in urothelial cancer. ',\n \"The notion that the immune system can act as a key factor in controlling cancer cell proliferation and thus its stimulation may be an important resource for cancer therapy has long been known. Tumors can elude the immune system by deploying proteins that shut down the immune response by binding to specific surface receptors on immune cells. Several promising strategies have been designed to overcome cancer cells' ability to suppress the immune surveillance. Immune checkpoint molecules that block cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (ipilimumab) or the programmed death-1/programmed death-ligand 1 axis (i.e., nivolumab and pembrolizumab) promote antitumor immunity, reactivating T-cell proliferation and activity. This efficient strategy currently represents one of the major oncological breakthroughs, with impressive clinically durable responses observed in cancer patients, particularly in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, NSCLC and more recently in bladder cancer patients. Fifteen years ago, we replaced the IL-2 and INF-α for molecular targeted therapies. Today, we believe that immune therapy will represent the future, perhaps as part of a combination of different therapeutic strategies that act synergistically in each tumor and individual patient. \",\n 'Immune-based therapies (e.g., IL-2, IFN) have been used for some time in advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with overall modest success. Recent advances have demonstrated that tumor cells evade immune-mediated destruction by inducing inhibitory signals that result in effector T-cell exhaustion. One mechanism involves interaction between the T-cell programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand, PD ligand-1, expressed on tumor and inflammatory cells. Nivolumab , an anti-PD-1 antibody, blocks this pathway, thereby reversing T-cell suppression and activating antitumor responses.\\nIn this review, the authors summarize selected aspects of PD-1 signaling, the development of immune checkpoint therapeutic agents, and clinical data regarding the safety and efficacy of nivolumab in RCC from Phase I and II clinical trials.\\nObjective responses and safety profiles of single-agent nivolumab are favorable in patients with previously treated and treatment-naive metastatic RCC. Combination therapies involving nivolumab are ongoing and have generated encouraging results. The use of nivolumab will have substantial impact on the management of patients with RCC.',\n \"Cancer cells employ several mechanisms to evade the immune system of their host, thus escaping immune recognition and elimination. Of particular interest is a cancer cell's ability to co-opt the immune system's innate ligands and inhibitory receptors (also known as checkpoints), thus creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that downregulates T-cell activation and cell signaling. The recent development of the checkpoint inhibitors anti-programmed death-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 has generated an enormous amount of interest as a potential new anticancer strategy in solid tumors, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Data suggest significant disease response rates using anti-programmed death-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 antibodies, even in heavily pretreated patients. Future directions include optimization of drug delivery sequence and combination of immunotherapy with other therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, antiangiogenic agents and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. \",\n 'In the past 5 years, the treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma has changed dramatically from being largely cytokine-based with the emergence of targeted therapy. Following the elucidation of various molecular pathways in renal cell carcinoma, targeted agents (particularly vascular endothelial growth factor-targeting antiangiogenic agents) now form the backbone of most therapeutic strategies for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and the outcome of treatment has improved. However, many tumors eventually develop resistance to targeted therapy due to secondary mutation of the target protein or compensatory changes within the target pathway that bypass the site of inhibition. On the other hand, there are new forms of immunotherapy that hold the promise of improving the outcome for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. In this article, we describe some of these new therapies, including the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, several receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, and tivozanib), the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus, and new immunotherapy modalities, such as anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen\\u20094 antibody and anti-programmed cell death\\u20091/programmed cell death-ligand\\u20091 antibody. We also discuss their role in the current management of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.',\n 'Melittin, a significant constituent of ',\n 'Sorafenib is an orally active, small-molecule multikinase inhibitor that blocks tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Studies have shown that it is a highly potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 2 and 3, platelet-derived growth factor-β, RAF, FLT-3, and c-Kit. This drug was recently approved for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. We report a case of a patient treated with sorafenib for metastatic renal cell carcinoma who developed scrotal eczema. ',\n 'The reaction of soft tripodal scorpionate ligand, sodium hydrotris(methimazolyl)borate with M(ClO4)2·6H2O [MMn(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) or Zn(II)] in methanol leads to the cleavage of B-N bond followed by the formation of complexes of the type [M(MeimzH)4](ClO4)2·H2O (1-4), where MeimzH=methimazole. All the complexes were fully characterized by spectro-analytical techniques. The molecular structure of the zinc(II) complex (4) was determined by X-ray crystallography, which supports the observed deboronation reaction in the scorpionate ligand with tetrahedral geometry around zinc(II) ion. The electronic spectra of complexes suggested tetrahedral geometry for manganese(II) and nickel(II) complexes, and square-planar geometry for copper(II) complex. Frontier molecular orbital analysis (HOMO-LUMO) was carried out by B3LYP/6-31G(d) to understand the charge transfer occurring in the molecules. All the complexes exhibit significant antimicrobial activity against Gram (-ve) and Gram (+ve) bacterial as well as fungal strains, which are quite comparable to standard drugs streptomycin and clotrimazole. The copper(II) complex (3) showed excellent free radical scavenging activity against DPPH in all concentration with IC50 value of 30μg/mL, when compared to the other complexes. In the molecular docking studies, all the complexes showed hydrophobic, π-π and hydrogen bonding interactions with BSA. The cytotoxic activity of the complexes against human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells was assessed by MTT assay, which showed exponential responses toward increasing concentration of complexes. ',\n 'Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antagonists have been investigated as a potential treatment for psoriasis, but there have been reports of VEGF antagonists triggering and/or exacerbating pre-existing psoriasis. We present the case of a 61-year old-man with exacerbation of pre-existing psoriasis after treatment with sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGF receptor, and we review the literature for other published cases of sorafenib-induced or sorafenib-exacerbated psoriasis. Clinicians, including both dermatologists and oncologists, should be aware of this potential side-effect of sorafenib in addition to the other cutaneous side effects reported for this drug. ',\n 'Biphenotypic (hepatobiliary) primary liver carcinomas [B(H-B)PLCs] are rare tumors with features of both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). These tumors are associated with a poor overall prognosis and treatment is not well defined. Research over the past 20 years has identified aberrations in several molecular pathways, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in hepatocellular and biliary tract cancers. These discoveries led to the evaluation of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, for the treatment of HCC and ICC. We report a case of a patient with metastatic B(H-B)PLC found to have a single nucleotide variant in the EGFR gene locus R521K who achieved a complete response on imaging after treatment with the combination of an EGFR inhibitor and a VEGF inhibitor. This case prompts consideration of further genomic analysis of these rare tumors and the potential use of targeted therapies in the treatment of patients with B(H-B)PLCs. ',\n 'As tumor angiogenesis is one of the hallmarks of cancer, the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor signaling has become an attractive anticancer approach. Apatinib, a small-molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, has demonstrated encouraging anticancer activity across a broad range of malignancies, including gastric cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this up-to-date review, focus is not only on the structure, mechanisms, and pharmacokinetics of apatinib, but also on summarizing clinical trials and making recommendations of apatinib for patients with advanced solid tumors. ',\n 'As a co-receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) plays an important role in angiogenesis and malignant progression of many human cancers. However, the role of NRP-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is not well understood. The study aimed to detected the expression of Neuropilin-1 in HCC and investigate the association between its expression and the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of HCC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot, Immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses were performed to characterize the expression of NRP-1 in HCC cell lines and tissues. The association of NRP-1 expression with the clinicopathological characteristics and the prognosis was subsequently assessed. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays revealed that the expression of NRP-1 in HCC was significantly increased relative to that of normal live cells and tissues (P < 0.05,and <0.001, respectively). In addition, high expression of NRP-1 was significantly associated with intrahepatic metastasis (P = 0.036), Edmondson grade (P = 0.007), TNM classification (P = 0.0031), and portal vein invasion (P = 0.004). Furthermore, the HCC patients with high NRP-1 expression had shorter overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS), whereas, patients with low NRP-1 expression had better OS and RFS (P = 0.0035, and 0.0048, respectively). These data indicate that NRP-1 expression may play an important role in the progression of HCC, and that high NRP-1 expression suggests unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and survival in HCC patients.',\n 'VEGFR-1 can promote invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal transition induction in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to elucidate VEGFR-1 impact on proteolytic enzymes profile involved with invasion.\\nThe effect on cell invasion was evaluated by invasive and migration assays with and without VEGFR-1 activation. The mechanism was investigated by real-time PCR, western blot and gelatin zymography using inhibitors for MMP-9. In total, 95 HCC patients were enrolled for its clinical value evaluation.\\nVEGFR-1 activation induced invasion in HCC cells with an increase in the expression and activity of MMP-9 and Snail. MMP-9 blockage effectively inhibited VEGFR-1-induced invasion. High coexpression of both in HCC predicted a worse clinical outcome.\\nData show a novel VEGFR-1 activation-to-MMP-9 mechanism promoting HCC invasion.',\n 'Hepatocellular Carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. Development of multidrug resistance is the main obstacle to the success of anticancer drugs. In this study, designing and docking study of thiosemicarbazide hybrids with amino acids or peptides against hepatocellular carcinoma was performed since hybrids of biologically active compounds with amino acids or peptides may show target specificity and lower toxicity. All the structures were drawn in 2D platform and converted to the 3D platform using ChemDraw 10.0. Evaluations of ADME properties were done by using QikProp 3.0 to check for the possibility of oral delivery. In silico prediction of LD50 values were performed using Pro-Tox webserver. Interestingly, it was found that conjugation with amino acids decreases toxicity and increases the therapeutic index of thiosemicarbazide. Finally, all the compounds were docked to the crystal structure of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 and Checkpoint kinase-1 utilizing Glide 5.0, Schrödinger 8.5, to understand the interaction of ligands with the receptor. A significant number of derivatives have been found active in both the receptors and also displayed multikinase inhibitory activity similar to Sorafenib, against hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, wet lab synthesis, in vitro ADMET and biological screening studies need to be performed to prove that designed compounds are effective against hepatocellular carcinoma as predicted by molecular modeling. However, as predicted by molecular modeling, the efficacy of designed compounds against hepatocellular carcinoma, needs to be confirmed by wet lab synthesis, in vitro ADMET and biological screening studies. ',\n 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and prognosis remains unsatisfactory when the disease is diagnosed at an advanced stage. Many molecular targeted agents are being developed for the treatment of advanced HCC; however, the only promising drug to have been developed is sorafenib, which acts as a multi-kinase inhibitor. Unfortunately, a subgroup of HCC is resistant to sorafenib, and the majority of these HCC patients show disease progression even after an initial satisfactory response. To date, a number of studies have examined the underlying mechanisms involved in the response to sorafenib, and trials have been performed to overcome the acquisition of drug resistance. The anti-tumor activity of sorafenib is largely attributed to the blockade of the signals from growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and the downstream RAF/mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK cascade. The activation of an escape pathway from RAF/MEK/ERK possibly results in chemoresistance. In addition, there are several features of HCCs indicating sorafenib resistance, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition and positive stem cell markers. Here, we review the recent reports and focus on the mechanism and prediction of chemoresistance to sorafenib in HCC. ',\n 'To study the potential molecular mechanism of tumor angiogenesis in its microenvironment, we investigated the effects of HepG2 conditioned medium on the proliferation of vascular endothelial cell and vascular angiogenesis in our laboratory. Human umbilical vein endothelial EA. hy926 cells were co-cultured with HepG2 conditioned medium in vitro. The proliferation and the tubulogenesis of EA. hy926 cells were detected by teramethylazo salt azole (MTT) and tube formation assay, respectively. The results showed that the survival rate of the EA. hy926 cells was significantly increased under the co-culture condition. HepG2 conditioned medium also enhanced the angiogenesis ability of EA. hy926 cells. In addition, the expressions of intracellular VEGF and extracellular VEGFR (Flk-1) were regulated upward in a time-dependent manner. In conclusion, the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and Vascula angiogenesis were improved under the condition of indirect co-culture.',\n 'Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the active constituent of turmeric extract has potent anti-cancer properties have been demonstrated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its underlying molecular mechanism of therapeutic effects remains unclear. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) have crucial roles in tumor angiogenesis.\\nThe goal of this study was to investigate the role of the VEGF/VEGFRs mediated angiogenesis during the proliferation and apoptosis of human HepG2 hepatoma cell line and the effect of curcumin-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers (Cur-NLC).\\nThe proliferation of HepG2 cells was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium after exposure to Cur-NLC and native curcumin. Apoptosis was quantified by flow cytometry with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide staining. Cellular internalization of Cur-NLC was observed by fluorescent microscope. The level of VEGF was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. The expression of VEGFRs was quantified by Western blotting.\\nCur-NLC was more effective in inhibiting the proliferation and enhancing the apoptosis of HepG2 cells than native curcumin. Fluorescent microscope analysis showed that HepG2 cells internalized Cur-NLC more effectively than native curcumin. Furthermore, Cur-NLC down-regulated the level of VEGF and the expression of VEGFR-2, but had a slight effect on VEGFR-1.\\nThese results clearly demonstrated that Cur-NLC was more effective in anti-cancer activity than the free form of curcumin. These studies demonstrate for the 1 st time that Cur-NLC exerts an antitumor effect on HepG2 cells by modulating VEGF/VEGFRs signaling pathway.',\n \"Despite adenovirus (Ad) vector's numerous advantages for cancer gene therapy, such as high ability of endosomal escape, efficient nuclear entry mechanism, and high transduction, and therapeutic efficacy, tumor specific targeting and antiviral immune response still remain as a critical challenge in clinical setting. To overcome these obstacles and achieve cancer-specific targeting, we constructed tumor targeting bioreducible polymer, an arginine grafted bio-reducible polymer (ABP)-PEG-HCBP1, by conjugating PEGylated ABP with HCBP1 peptides which has high affinity and selectivity towards hepatoma. The ABP-PEG-HCBP1-conjugated replication incompetent GFP-expressing ad, (Ad/GFP)-ABP-PEG-HCBP1, showed a hepatoma cancer specific uptake and transduction compared to either naked Ad/GFP or Ad/GFP-ABP. Competition assays demonstrated that Ad/GFP-ABP-PEG-HCBP1-mediated transduction was specifically inhibited by HCBP1 peptide rather than coxsackie and adenovirus receptor specific antibody. In addition, ABP-PEG-HCBP1 can protect biological activity of Ad against serum, and considerably reduced both innate and adaptive immune response against Ad. shMet-expressing oncolytic Ad (oAd; RdB/shMet) complexed with ABP-PEG-HCBP1 delivered oAd efficiently into hepatoma cancer cells. The oAd/ABP-PEG-HCBP1 demonstrated enhanced cancer cell killing efficacy in comparison to oAd/ABP complex. Furthermore, Huh7 and HT1080 cancer cells treated with oAd/shMet-ABP-PEG-HCBP1 complex had significantly decreased Met and VEGF expression in hepatoma cancer, but not in non-hepatoma cancer. In sum, these results suggest that HCBP1-conjugated bioreducible polymer could be used to deliver oncolytic Ad safely and efficiently to treat hepatoma. \",\n 'Deregulated expression of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase has been reported in up to 50% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most abundant form of liver cancers, and is associated with decreased survival. Consequently, MET is considered as a molecular target in this malignancy, whose progression is highly dependent on extensive angiogenesis. Here we studied the impact of MET small molecule inhibitors on angiogenesis-associated parameters and growth of xenograft liver models consisting of cells expressing MET-mutated variants M1268T and Y1248H, which exhibit constitutive kinase activity. We demonstrate that MET mutations expression is associated with significantly increased production of vascular endothelial growth factor, which is blocked by MET targeting only in cells expressing the M1268T inhibitor-sensitive but not in the Y1248H inhibitor-resistant variant. Decrease in vascular endothelial growth factor production is also associated with reduction of tyrosine phopshorylation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expressed on primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and with inhibition of vessel formation. Furthermore, MET inhibition demonstrated an efficient anti-tumor activity and considerable reduction in microvessel density only against the M1268T-derived intrahepatic tumors. Collectively, our data support the role of targeting MET-associated angiogenesis as a major biological determinant for liver tumor growth control. ',\n 'Hepatocellular carcinoma is a challenging malignancy of global importance. It is the sixth most common solid malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death, worldwide. Curative treatments at early stages include liver transplantation, resection and percutaneous ablation, while transarterial chemoembolization can improve survival in patients with intermediate tumor stage. Patients with mild, related symptoms and/or macrovascular invasion or extrahepatic spread are classified under the advanced stage. The standard of care in this group is sorafenib, an inhibitor of Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, whose effectiveness has been proven by 2 recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The aim of this brief review is to highlight the main concerns and pitfalls and to analyze the recent data of literature regarding the efficacy and the management of sorafenib therapy from RCTs to real practice. ',\n 'The efficacy and safety of axitinib, a potent and selective vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1-3 inhibitor, combined with best supportive care (BSC) was evaluated in a global, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial in patients with locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).\\nPatients with HCC and Child-Pugh Class A who progressed on or were intolerant to one prior antiangiogenic therapy were stratified by tumour invasion (presence/absence of extrahepatic spread and/or vascular invasion) and region (Asian/non-Asian) and randomized (2:1) to axitinib/BSC (starting dose 5 mg twice-daily) or placebo/BSC. The primary end point was overall survival (OS).\\nThe estimated hazard ratio for OS was 0.907 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.646-1.274; one-sided stratified P = 0.287] for axitinib/BSC (n = 134) versus placebo/BSC (n = 68), with the median (95% CI) of 12.7 (10.2-14.9) versus 9.7 (5.9-11.8) months, respectively. Results of prespecified subgroup analyses in Asian versus non-Asian patients or presence versus absence of tumour invasion were consistent with the overall population. Improvements favouring axitinib/BSC (P < 0.01) were observed in secondary efficacy end point analyses [progression-free survival (PFS), time to tumour progression (TTP), and clinical benefit rate (CBR)], and were retained among Asian patients in the prespecified subgroup analyses. Overall response rate did not differ significantly between treatments and patient-reported outcomes favoured placebo/BSC. Most common all-causality adverse events with axitinib/BSC were diarrhoea (54%), hypertension (54%), and decreased appetite (47%). Baseline serum analyses identified potential new prognostic (interleukin-6, E-selectin, interleukin-8, angiopoietin-2, migration inhibitory factor, and c-MET) or predictive (E-selectin and stromal-derived factor-1) factors for survival.\\nAxitinib/BSC did not improve OS over placebo/BSC in the overall population or in stratification subgroups. However, axitinib/BSC resulted in significantly longer PFS and TTP and higher CBR, with acceptable toxicity in patients with advanced HCC.\\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01210495.',\n 'Structure novelty, chemical stability and synthetic feasibility attracted us to design 1,2,3-triazole compounds as potential inhibitors of VEGFR2 tyrosine kinase. Novel triazoles T1-T7 were proposed by oxazole (AAZ from PDB: 1Y6A)/1,2,3-triazole isosteric replacement, molecular modelling and docking. In order to enable synthesis of T1-T7 we developed a methodology for preparation of ynamide 22. Compound 22 was used for all Click chemistry reactions leading to triazoles T1-T3 and T6-T7. Among the obtained products, T1, T3 and T7 specifically bind VEGFR2 TK and modulate its activity by concentration dependent manner. Moreover predicted binding poses of T1-T7 in VEGFR2 TK were similar to the one known for the oxazole inhibitor AAZ (PDB: 1Y6A). Unfortunately the VEGFR2 inhibition by triazoles e.g. T3 and T7 is lower than that determined for their oxazole bioisosters T3-ox and AAZ, resp. Different electronic properties of 1,2,3-triazole/oxazole heterocyclic rings were proposed to be the main reason for the diminished affinity of T1-T3, T6 and T7 to an oxazole AAZ inhibitor binding site in VEGFR2 TK (PDB: 1Y6A or 1Y6B). Moreover T1-T3 and T6 were screened on cytotoxic activity against two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Selective cytotoxic activity of T2 against aggressive Mahlavu cells has been discovered indicating possible affinity of T2 to Mahlavu constitutionally active PI3K/Akt pathway. ',\n 'Cancer stem cells (CSCs) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) possess tumor-initiating, metastatic, and drug resistance properties. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of PEGylated interferon-α2a (PEG-IFN-α2a) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on the expression of CSC markers and on specific pathways that contribute to the propagation of CSCs in HCC. HCC was initiated in rats using a single intraperitoneal dose of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) (200\\xa0mg/kg) and promoted by weekly subcutaneous injections of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 6\\xa0weeks. After the appearance of dysplastic nodules, the animals received PEG-IFN-α2a or 5-FU for 8\\xa0weeks. CSC markers (OV6, CD90) and molecules related to transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) and other signaling pathways were assessed in hepatic tissues. The PEG-IFN-α2a treatment effectively suppressed the hepatic expression of OV6 and CD90, ameliorated the diminished hepatic expression of TGF-β receptor II (TGF-βRII) and β2-spectrin (β2SP), and significantly reduced the elevated hepatic expression of TGF-β1, interleukin6 (IL6), signal transducer and activator of transcription3 (STAT3), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, the 5-FU treatment failed to reduce the overexpression of CSC markers and barely affected the disrupted TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, it had no effect on angiogenesis or nitrosative stress. PEG-IFN-α2a, but not 5-FU, could reduce the propagation of CSCs during the progression of HCC by upregulating the disrupted TGF-β signaling, suppressing the IL6/STAT3 pathway and reducing angiogenesis. ',\n 'Antiangiogenic therapy has recently emerged as a highly promising therapeutic strategy for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the only clinically approved systemic antiangiogenic agent for advanced HCC is sorafenib, which exerts considerable toxicity. Moreover, acquired resistance to antiangiogenic therapy often develops and restricts the therapeutic efficacy of this treatment. Hence, in this study, we develop a CXCR4-targeted lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) formulation to specifically deliver vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) siRNA as an antiangiogenic substance into HCC. AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, is added into NPs to serve as both a targeting moiety and a sensitizer to antiangiogenic therapy. We demonstrate that AMD-modified NPs (AMD-NPs) can efficiently deliver VEGF siRNAs into HCC and downregulate VEGF expression in vitro and in vivo. Despite the upregulation of the SDF1α/CXCR4 axis upon the induction of hypoxia after antiangiogenic therapy, CXCR4 inhibition by AMD-NPs in combination with either conventional sorafenib treatment or VEGF siRNA prevents the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages. These dual treatments also induce synergistic antiangiogenic effects and suppress local and distant tumor growth in HCC. In conclusion, the tumor-targeted multifunctional AMD-NPs that co-deliver VEGF siRNA and AMD3100 provide an effective approach for overcoming tumor evasion of antiangiogenic therapy, leading to delayed tumor progression in HCC. ',\n 'Sorafenib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases controlling tumor growth and angiogenesis. The purpose of the phase 2 study was to determine the response rate of sorafenib and gain further information on the associated toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).\\nSorafenib, 200\\u2009mg/m(2) /dose, was administered every 12\\u2009hr continuously for 28 day cycles using a two-stage design in two primary strata (rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor) and two secondary strata (HCC and PTC). Correlative studies in consenting patients included determination of sorafenib steady state trough concentrations and assessments of VEGF and sVEGFR2.\\nTwenty patients (median age of 11 years; range, 5-21) enrolled. No objective responses (RECIST) were observed in the 10 evaluable patients enrolled in each of the two primary disease strata of rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor. No patients with HCC or PTC were enrolled. Sorafenib was not associated with an excessive rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The mean\\u2009±\\u2009SD steady state concentration during cycle 1 day 15 was 6.5\\u2009±\\u20093.9\\u2009μg/ml (n\\u2009=\\u200910).\\nSorafenib was well tolerated in children at 200\\u2009mg/m(2) /dose twice daily on a continuous regimen with toxicity profile and steady state drug concentrations similar to those previously reported. Single agent sorafenib was inactive in children with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma or Wilms tumor.',\n 'Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) gene amplification/overexpression is a major therapeutic target in breast cancer, and has been introduced as a predictive biomarker to identify patients who may benefit from therapy with anti-HER2 agents. HER2 somatic mutations have been reported, and these may influence the effect of HER2-targeted drugs.\\nHere, we sought HER2 mutations in a group of 135 Japanese breast cancer patients with HER2-positive tumors. We analyzed HER2 mutations by direct Sanger sequencing of two major areas, the extracellular domain at position 309-310 and the kinase domain between 755 and 781.\\nTwo patients with the HER2 somatic mutation S310F in the extracellular domain were found in this series. One patient with the S310F mutation had a node-negative invasive ductal carcinoma classified as HER2 2+ by the HercepTest and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive, and which was estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and progesterone receptor (PgR)-negative. Another patient with the S310F mutation had an apocrine carcinoma with seven lymph nodes positive for metastasis, classified as HER2 3+ by the HercepTest, but which was FISH-negative, as well as ER-negative and PgR-negative. Both patients had received adjuvant single-agent trastuzumab therapy, and had no local recurrence or distant metastasis for five and three years after surgery, respectively.\\nOur data show that HER2 mutations are rare in HER2-positive Japanese breast cancer patients. The two mutations found in this study were identical, S310F. We suggest that in vitro experiments to determine whether the S310F mutation could be involved in resistance to anti-HER2 drugs are worthwhile in future.',\n 'Most studies analyzing prognostic factors for late relapse have been performed in postmenopausal women who received tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer.\\nA total of 223 patients (108 premenopausal and 115 postmenopausal) with early distant recurrence and 149 patients (62 premenopausal and 87 postmenopausal) with late distant recurrence of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who were given their initial treatment between 2000 and 2004 were registered from nine institutions. For each late recurrence patient, approximately two matched control patients without relapse for more than 10\\xa0years were selected. Clinicopathological factors and adjuvant therapies were compared among the three groups by menopausal status and age.\\nFactors predicting early recurrence in premenopausal women were large tumor size, high lymph node category and high tumor grade, whereas predictors for late recurrence were large tumor size and high lymph node category. In postmenopausal women under 60\\xa0years of age, factors predicting early recurrence were bilateral breast cancer, large tumor size, high lymph node category, low PgR expression and high Ki67 labeling index (LI), while predictors for late recurrence were large tumor size and high lymph node category. On the other hand, in postmenopausal women aged 60\\xa0years or older, factors predicting early recurrence were bilateral breast cancer, large tumor size, high lymph node category, high tumor grade, low ER expression and high Ki67 LI, whereas predictors for late recurrence were high lymph node category, low ER expression and short duration of adjuvant endocrine therapy.\\nPredictors of early and late distant recurrence might differ according to menopausal status and age.',\n 'To investigate the risk factors of cerebral metastasis of breast cancer and to provide guidance for the early diagnosis and treatment of brain metastases.\\nClinical data of postoperative patients with breast cancer were collected in our hospital from 2005 to 2009. All the patients were divided into two groups, with or without brain metastasis. The risk factors of brain metastases of patients with breast cancer were analyzed by the logistic regression.\\nEight hundred and twenty four early postoperative patients with breast cancer were enrolled. The median follow-up time was 68 months and 199 cases had brain metastasis. The univariate logistic regression results showed that higher grade of tumor, <35 years, premenopausal, clinical stage Ⅲ, HER-2 positive and ER negative, no adjuvant chemotherapy, no adjuvant normal therapy were the risk factors of brain metastasis. The multivariate logistic regression result showed that higher grade of tumor, <35 years, premenopausal, clinical stage Ⅲ, HER-2 positive, ER negative were the risk factors. The mathematical model was used to predict the probability of occurrence of brain metastasis. ROC curve were draw by the value of predict probability as test variable and the brain metastasis status as state variables. The AUC value of this predictive model was 0.743±0.018. The specificity and sensitivity are relative high.\\nAge<35 years, premenopausal, clinical stage Ⅲ, HER-2 positive and ER negative were independent risk factors for brain metastases. This model has the predictive value for the occurrence of brain metastases from breast cancer.',\n 'Accurate assessment of HER-2 status is essential for identifying patients who will benefit from HER-2 targeted therapy. The aim of the present study was to show results on the concordance between local and central laboratory testing results in HER-2 positive breast cancer patients. In cases with discordant findings, the immunohistochemical (IHC) and/or in situ hybridization (FISH/SISH) analysis was performed in central laboratories. A total of 104 out of 143 (72.72%) breast carcinoma cases were HER-2 positive (score 3+), while nearly 14% of tumors (20/43) showed weak (score 2+) and 12% (19/143) negative IHC staining (score 0 and 1+). After repeated IHC and ISH, 88% (126/143) were classified as HER-2 positive and 12% (17/143) as HER-2 negative cases. The results obtained are in agreement with many studies that confirmed similar discordance in HER-2 testing by IHC and/or FISH between local and central laboratory. Thus, our findings as well as those from other studies support the importance of regular quality assessment of the staining procedures performed and consistency of interpretation of HER-2 test results.',\n 'Companion diagnostics (CoDx) will likely continue to rapidly increase in number and application to disease areas including solid tumors, for example EGFR for gefitinib and ALK fusion gene for crizotinib in non-small-cell lung cancer; KRAS against the use of cetuximab and panitumumab in colorectal cancer; HER2 for trastuzumab in breast cancer. CoDx are an indispensable part of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics. In CoDx development, there are still many challenges, such as the business model promoting cooperation between diagnostics and pharmaceutical companies, and also the regulations related to CoDx. The FDA notice on the development of CoDx in 2011 recommended the co-development of a new drug and CoDx as the best practice, and the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan also issued a statement in 2013. In addition, the recent discovery of many novel variants in the DNA sequence, advances in sequencing and genomic technology, and improved analytic methods have enabled the impact of germline and somatic mutations to be determined using multiplex diagnosis. The complex challenges to develop CoDx necessitate a close collaboration among academic institutions, regulatory authorities, and pharmaceutical companies. [Review].',\n 'Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in Western countries after skin tumors. Successful treatment depends on many factors, relies on clinical examination, diagnostic procedures, pathologic evaluation, and good therapy decision. The Pathologic diagnosis should be the determining factor in the decision on therapeutic approach. There are several methods of obtaining tissue samples. The percutaneous ultrasound guided breast Core needle biopsy (CNB) is one of them. The Aim of this Study is to evaluate our experience in the accuracy of hormone receptors assessment in ultrasound guided CNB. In our institution, in last 12 month 60 women (with 67 lesions) underwent Breast CNB. The CNB was performed with 16 Gauge semiautomatic biopsy needle with 15 Gauge coordinated introducer needle. 3-6 specimen (mean 4) were taken during the procedure. We analyzed five factors (histological type, histological grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and HER2 from the biopsied sample. All results were presented at the Multidisciplinary Oncology Team. In addition to demographic data and morphological features of the lesion, we analyzed five pathological factors (histological type, histological grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and HER2 from the biopsied sample. All results were presented at the Multidisciplinary Oncology Team. Ultrasound-guided CNB has proven to be a reliable technique for performing a biopsy for breast. It is a good and reliable, complication free method, for preoperative staging, operative planning as well for prognostic value. It is a cost-effective method, can be performed quickly and in outpatient population, does not deform the breast and multiple lesions can be biopsied. This technique shows a high sensitivity value and offers many advantages over other imaging methods to guide a biopsy. All advantages have made this technique the most widespread used technique to perform a biopsy for a suspicious breast lesion.',\n 'The potential of the immune system to recognize and reject tumors has been investigated for more than a century. However, only recently impressive breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have been seen with the use of checkpoint inhibitors. The experience with various immune-based strategies in the treatment of late cancer highlighted the importance of negative impact advanced disease has on immunity. Consequently, use of immune modulation for cancer prevention rather than therapy has gained considerable attention, with many promising results seen already in preclinical and early clinical studies. Although not without challenges, these results provide much excitement and optimism that successful cancer immunoprevention could be within our reach. In this review we will discuss the current state of predominantly primary and secondary cancer immunoprevention, relevant research, potential barriers, and future directions. ',\n 'Introduction of trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of HER-2, is a cornerstone in the treatment of HER-2+ breast carcinoma. However, many cancers that have an initial response to trastuzumab will progress some time later. After progression on trastuzumab-based first-line treatment, there are several options. Although TDM-1 (Trastuzumab emtansine) has prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in patients previously treated with trastuzumab and taxane, it is still not available in Turkey. Patients may be switched to lapatinib (an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting both HER-1 and HER-2), or they may re-challenge with trastuzumab. There is no clear definition of the patients who should be switched to lapatinib.\\nIn this study, we investigated the factors predicting the efficacy of lapatinib.\\nTotally, 94 patients treated with lapatinib for metastatic breast carcinoma was included in our study. Retrospective data including pathology, treatments and treatment results, metastatic sites, and laboratory tests were collected.\\nProgression-free survival was 9.1 months. Histologic subtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma and liver metastasis were inversely related with PFS. Overall survival was 22.1 months, and patients with histologic subtypes other than invasive ductal carcinoma and who progress with brain metastasis had a worse prognosis.\\nClinicians should give attention to histologic subtype and metastatic sites when choosing patients for lapatinib treatment.',\n 'Brain metastasis of primary breast cancer (BCBM) has been rising during the last couple of decades. Approximately 25% of the patients with BCBM have a hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive disease. Given the short life expectancy in patients with BCBM, researchers have tried many new approaches, including cesium-131(131Cs) brachytherapy, radretumab radioimmunotherapy and nanoparticles. Novel biological drug delivery techniques have successfully delivered nanobioconjugates across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, nanobioconjugates have significant toxicities and other drawbacks that prevent therapeutic concentrations of the active drug from being delivered to the brain lesions. Radretumab radioimmunotherapy combined with nanotrastruzumab can theoretically overcome this challenge. Radiotherapy can increase the BBB permeability, which can promote the transport and effect of nanotrastuzumab, reduce radretumab radioimmunotherapy dose and target patients with HER2-positive BCBM lesions more specifically. In this article, we propose that nanotrastuzumab in combination with radioimmunotherapy could be a viable treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastasis. ',\n 'The aim of this study was to determine the expression level of Aurora A in human breast cancer tissues and to test whether there is a relationship between its expression levels and clinicopathological parameters including response to taxanes, tumor grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and overall survival (OS).\\nWe retrospectively analyzed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from 49 metastatic breast cancer patients whose clinical outcomes had been tracked after taxane treatment. The expression status of Aurora A was defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using the anti-Aurora A antibody.\\nAurora A was overexpressed in 73% of the examined specimens. There was significant correlation between high Aurora A expression and decreased taxane sensitivity (p=0.02). There was no association between the clinicopathological parameters including histologic grade, ER positivity and triple negative molecular subtype and the level of Aurora A expression. However, HER2 positive tumors showed significantly higher Aurora A expression compared with HER2 negative tumors (p=0.02). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis failed to show a significant correlation between expression levels of Aurora A and OS although patients with low Aurora A levels had a marginally longer survival compared to patients with high levels.\\nOur data suggest that Aurora A may be a promising predictive and prognostic marker in patients with breast cancer.',\n None,\n \"To investigate the effect of risk factors on ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS) for patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who underwent breast-conserving treatment (BCT).\\nA series of 1 835 patients with primary breast cancer treated with BCT in a single institute between December 1999 and August 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. Totally 1 614 patients, whose characteristics were intact, were analyzed to compare their outcomes with respect to the incidence of IBTR, DDFS and disease-free survival (DFS). All of patients were female. Median age was 47 years (ranging 21 to 92 years, interquartile range 14 years). According to the immunohistochemical results of the patients, 1 614 cases were divided into TNBC group (n=308) and non-TNBC group (n=1 306). The risk factors of relapse after breast-conserving treatment (age at diagnosis, spread to axillary lymph nodes, hormone receptor status, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and maximal tumor diameter, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) status, preoperative MRI, the location and extent of the tumor bed defined by CT scans for electron boost planning as part of breast radiotherapy) were studied.χ(2) test was used to compare the distribution of baseline characteristics among subtypes. The probability of survival (or relapse occurrence), and DDFS were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidence functions were used to describe the cumulative hazard from LR, IBTR and DDFS in the presence of competing risks.\\nA total of 1 614 women with primary breast cancer underwent a breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 77 months (interquartile range 36 months). One hundred and forty patients (8.6%) were lost to follow-up. Overall 5-year IBTR rate was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.2% to 4.0%), 5-year DDFS rate was 95.8% (95% CI: 94.9% to 96.7%) and 5-year DFS rate was 93.8% (95% CI: 92.7% to 94.9%). Lymph nodal involvement (HR=3.03, 95% CI: 1.66 to 5.51, P=0.000) and use of CT information in boost field planning (HR=0.40, 95% CI: 0.20 to 0.80, P=0.010) were associated significantly with IBTR in Cox multivariable analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that TNBC doesn't have a significantly increased risk of IBTR compared with the non-TNBC subtype (HR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.76, P=0.78). TNBC was not an independent risk factor for DDFS or DFS. The multivariable model showed significant effect of nodal status and age at diagnosis on 5-year DDFS rate and 5-year DFS rate.\\nBreast-conserving treatment for TNBC is not associated with increased IBTR compared with non-TNBC subtype. Use of CT information in boost field planning can reduce the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for patients undergoing BCT.\",\n 'To explore the clinical and pathological characteristics of stage IV breast cancer and to analyze their relationship with the morbidity and prognosis.\\nThe records of 66 patients presenting from January 2008 to December 2014 with stage IV breast cancer were reviewed. All of the patients were women and the median age was 57.5 (31 to 80) years, accounted for 3.01% (66/2 189) among the breast cancer patients treated in the same period. Statistical methods were used to analyze the correlation between clinical and pathological characteristics such as T-stage, N-stage, immuno-histo-chemistry and the morbidity and prognosis of stage IV breast cancer. The influence of patients characteristics to metastasis were compared by χ(2) test. Kaplan-Meier curves were reported for overall survival (OS), and the Log-rank test was used to compare the difference in groups. Cox proportional models were fitted for multivariate analysis.\\nThe median survival time of stage IV breast cancer was 56.0 months and the 5-year survival rate was 40%. To metastasis, the effects of age, subtypes, histological grade, hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)had no significant statistics differences. It was concluded that the expression of HER2 (P=0.003) and HR (P=0.001) as well as single metastasis (P=0.029) were the influencing factors of the survival by multivariate Cox regression analysis. Primary tumor R0 surgery group and no surgery group had no significant statistics differences of overall survival and the 5-year survival rate (P=0.102).\\nClinical and pathological characteristics have no effect on metastasis. The expression of HER2 and HR as well as single metastasis play important roles in survival.',\n 'To analyze the survival of breast cancer molecular subtypes and to examine the effect of therapy on the long-term prognosis of different subtypes.\\nThis study included 3 586 breast cancer patients with estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) information in Shanghai Breast Cancer Survival Study, a population-based prospective cohort study established in 2002. Molecular subtypes, based on immunohistochemistry were categorized as follows: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2, and triple-negative subtype. Characteristics and clinical data were collected through questionnaires and medical records at baseline survey and sequential follow-up surveys. Survival rates of different molecular subtypes were analyzed and compared with Log-rank tests. Multiple Cox regression models were used to evaluate the effect of therapy on long-term prognosis of different molecular subtypes.\\nAmong the 3 586 cases, Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 and triple-negative breast cancer subtypes accounted for 54.5%, 16.6%, 13.9%, and 14.9%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 10.3 years (ranging 0.6 to 12.8 years), the 10-year overall survival (OS) rates for the four subtypes were 82.7% (95% CI: 80.9% to 84.4%), 77.7% (95% CI: 74.1% to 80.8%), 76.3% (95% CI: 72.3% to 79.8%), and 74.8% (95% CI: 70.9% to 78.3%), respectively. The 10-year disease to free survival (DFS) rates were 79.0% (95% CI: 76.7% to 81.0%), 76.0% (95% CI: 71.9% to 79.5%), 73.6% (95% CI: 68.9% to 77.7%), and 74.5% (95% CI: 69.4% to 78.9%), respectively. Significant difference in survival among four subtypes was observed (Log-rank test, P<0.01). Multivariate Cox regression indicated that hormonal therapy can significantly reduce the long-term risk of total mortality and recurrence breast cancer specific mortality among Luminal A subtype patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy could improve the long-term prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer. No benefit from radiotherapy was observed for four subtypes of breast cancer in terms of long-term prognosis.\\nMolecular subtypes based on ER/PR/HER2 could provide important information to predict breast cancer prognosis. The hormonal status was an important basis for individualized therapy and precision medicine.',\n 'Breast cancer is the most prevalent malignancy among females worldwide. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer represents a subtype with aggressive behavior, poor response to treatment and unfavorable prognosis. Anti-HER2-based neoadjuvant treatment has improved clinical outcomes of patients with HER2-positive disease. Pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment indicates a favorable prognosis. With the development of HER2-targeted therapy and neoadjuvant treatment, numerous studies focus on the predictive factors of pCR or therapeutic resistance of anti-HER2 therapy. Identification of novel predictive factors in HER2-positive breast cancer, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, will be helpful for clinical decision. ',\n 'Disputes take place among many scientists about the position of MC in the classification of breast cancer. Some say that this kind of tumor is a sign of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Instead, most of modern researchers distinguish MC of the breast as a separate nosological unit. Primarily there were selected 20 cases of MC and 10 cases of IDC (as control group). The immunohistochemical study revealed the presence of ER, PR, HER2/neo, p53, Ki-67, MMP1 and E-cadherin receptors. In the study of receptor status of tumors it was observed that 100% of MC cases were estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2/ neu negative. The status of tumors on receptor p53 and Ki-67 was as follows: p53+ status had 80% and Ki-67+ had 85% of tissues of MC. In 75% of cases MC cells expressed marker of adhesion and in 100% of cases cells were receptor-negative for expression of MMP1. The data of the study show that the invasive ductal carcinoma and medullary carcinoma are completely independent and different types of malignancy in the breast. The favorable behavior of medullary cancer is associated with expression of E-cadherin receptors, which are essentially adhesion factor and absence of MMP1 which are factors of metastatic potential of the tumor. ',\n 'IHC results for HER2/neu vary with replicate testing using the same antibody clone and when alternate clones are utilized. A number of factors appear to be responsible for this variability, including fixation times, equipment utilized and training and experience of staff. A number of studies have documented interobserver variability for a single antibody clone but few have evaluated reproducibility between antibody clones and which clones demonstrate the highest degree of interobserver reproducibility.\\nWe studied a series of 93 cases stained by both the HercepTest™ and the 4B5 clone for interobserver reproducibility. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained by the immunohistochemical technique using the manufactures directions for both the HercepTest™ and the 4B5 clone. FISH testing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections according to the PathVysion HER-2 DNA probe kit instructions.\\nAbsolute agreement rate for Hercep was 85%. Absolute agreement for 4B5 was 69%. This difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The chance-corrected agreement (weighted kappa) for the HercepTest™ was 79% and 71% for 4B5 (p<0.0001). Absolute agreement between antibody clones was 58% with the chance corrected agreement being 51%. Absolute agreement of 4B5 with FISH was significantly greater than that of the HercepTest™ (54% vs 35%).\\nAgreement between evaluators was greater with the HercepTest. However, agreement with FISH results was superior for the 4B5 clone. Interobserver agreement was less than the 95% agreement threshold recommended by the ASCO/CAP guidelines for development of a new testing method for HER2 evaluation.',\n 'We report on prognostic factors and long-term survival of non-metastatic breast cancer patients treated at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH and RC) in Pakistan.\\nThis retrospective cohort study is based on a review of 2829 pathologically confirmed non-metastatic breast cancer patients managed from January 1995 to May 2009. Median age was 45 years. Stage at presentation: Stage I (9%), stage II (59%), and stage III (32%). Infiltrating ductal carcinoma (92%) constituted the most prevalent histological subtype. Estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and Her2-neu were positive in 49%, 50%, and 26%, respectively. A mastectomy was performed in 67% and conservative surgery in 33% of the patients. Post-operative radiotherapy was delivered in 85% of the cases. Ninety percent of the patients received chemotherapy and mainly consisted of anthracycline-based regimens + taxanes. Hormonal manipulation was done in ER/PR positive patients.\\nThe 5- and 10-year overall survival (OS) was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 68.2-71.8%) and 54% (95%CI: 51.2-56.8%), while disease free survival (DFS) was 65% (95% CI: 63-67%) and 52% (95% CI: 49.2-54.8%), respectively. Recurrence following primary treatment was seen in 35% of the patients. On multivariate analysis T stage, number of axillary nodal involvement, tumor grade, ER status and family history, were found to be independent predictors for OS and DFS.\\nOver 90% of non-metastatic breast cancer patients present with stagesII and III disease and a significant proportion develop distant metastasis accounting for overall long-term outcome inferior to developed countries. Efforts should be directed to raise the level of health awareness and screening programs to improve early detection in Pakistan.',\n 'Although survival rates among patients with breast cancer have improved in recent years, those diagnosed with advanced disease with distant metastasis face a 5-year survival rate of less than 25%, making the management of these patients an area still in significant need of continued research. Selecting the optimal treatment order from among the variety of currently available therapy options presents a relevant challenge for medical oncologists. With the understanding that the majority of patients with breast cancer and those who succumb to this disease have HR-positive disease, this review will focus on treatment options and treatment order in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. While endocrine therapy is considered the preferred treatment for first-line therapy in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, selection of the specific agent depends on the menopausal status of the patient. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, is also recommended as first-line treatment in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease. In patients with endocrine therapy-resistant disease, specific strategies include sequencing of other antiestrogen receptor agents, or agents that target other molecular pathways. Future treatment strategies for patients with primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy for advanced disease are discussed. These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene. ',\n \"No 'gold standard' exists for single-agent chemotherapy of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-negative) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in the second-line. The objective of this systematic review is to identify and appraise overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP) and Grade ≥3 adverse event evidence for single-agent chemotherapy in this setting.\\nMEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched to October 2013, and PubMed October 2013 to November 2014. Electronic database searches were supplemented with hand searching of reference lists and conferences. Eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) employed at least one single-agent chemotherapy treatment, enrolled HER2-negative or unselected MBC patients who had progressed following first-line chemotherapy within the metastatic setting, and reported outcomes of interest for the second-line setting.\\nFifty-three RCTs were included in total, with most containing mixed populations by HER2 status and treatment line. Fourteen studies reported data specifically for second- and later-line treatment within the metastatic setting. Median overall survival (OS) in most trials was 8-13 months. Only one trial reported a significant difference between studied interventions in the second-line metastatic setting: nab-paclitaxel (n=131) conferred a statistically significant OS advantage vs. three-weekly paclitaxel (n=136) (median OS 13.0 vs. 10.7 months, respectively; hazard ratio 0.73, p=0.024) and improved overall safety.\\nOne RCT demonstrated significant benefit in this setting in confirmed HER2-negative MBC alongside favourable safety. Treatment line terminology was imprecise. To reliably inform patient treatment decisions, quality-of-life data are needed and precise OS estimation according to underlying patient characteristics.\",\n 'Fedratinib (SAR302503/TG101348) is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)-selective inhibitor developed for treatment of patients with myelofibrosis. The effect of food intake on the pharmacokinetics (PKs) and tolerability of single-dose fedratinib was investigated in two Phase I studies (FED12258: 100\\u2009mg or 500\\u2009mg under fasted or fed [high-fat breakfast] conditions; ALI13451: 500\\u2009mg under fasted or fed [low- or high-fat breakfast] conditions) in healthy male subjects. At the 500\\u2009mg dose the fed:fasted ratio estimate for area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity was 0.96 (100\\u2009mg; high-fat/fasted), 1.19-1.24 (500\\u2009mg; high-fat/fasted), and 1.22 (500\\u2009mg; low-fat/fasted). Fedratinib 500\\u2009mg attained peak plasma concentration 4\\u2009hours after a high-fat breakfast and 2-2.5\\u2009hours after a low-fat breakfast or under fasted conditions; terminal half-life was 76-88\\u2009hours (fasted) and 73-78\\u2009hours (fed). The most frequent adverse events were mild gastrointestinal toxicities, the incidence of which decreased following a high-fat breakfast compared with both fasted and low-fat breakfast conditions (17%, 67%, and 59% of subjects, respectively, in ALI13451). In conclusion, food intake had minimal impact on the PKs of fedratinib, and the tolerability of this drug was improved when taken following a high-fat breakfast.',\n 'Secondary malignancies, particularly solid tumors, are common in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but association of myeloproliferative neoplasms and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in the same patient is very rare.\\nWe report of a 67-year-old man with B-cell chronic lymphoid leukemia (B-CLL) who developed primary myelofibrosis (PMF) nine years after initial diagnosis. Patient received alkylation agents and purine analogue, which can be a predisposing factor for the development of myeloproliferative neoplasms. JAK2V617F mutation was not present initially at the time of CLL diagnosis, but was found after nine years when PMF occurred, which indicates that B-CLL and PMF represent two separate clonal origin neoplasms.\\nPathogenic mechanisms for the development of myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative neoplasms in the same patient are unknown. Further research is needed to determine whether these malignancies originate from two different cell clones or arise from the same pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell.',\n 'Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF), are clonal hematopoietic diseases. A single-institution retrospective analysis was performed, including 71 MPN patients diagnosed at the Hakodate Municipal Hospital between April, 2001 and April, 2014, and certain clinical characteristics were identified as effective prognostic factors. The patients were categorized by risk factor scoring based on age, number of abnormal blood cell lineages and splenomegaly at diagnosis, and the association between this categorization and prognosis was analyzed using a statistical procedure. The effect of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation on prognosis was also investigated. The MPN patients were consolidated into three risk groups based on the margin of intergroup survival differences: i) Score 1-2 (n=23), ii) score 3 (n=24) and iii) score 4-5 (n=24). MPN patients with scores of 4 or 5 exhibited poorer overall survival (OS) compared with those with lower scores (P<0.001). In addition, there were significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) among scoring groups (P=0.0059). PV and ET had a better prognosis compared with PMF, although this analysis suggested that PV and ET patients with scores of 4 or 5 may have a poorer prognosis in terms of OS (P=0.0052) and EFS (P=0.022) and should be closely followed up. We observed no significant prognostic effect of the JAK2V167F mutation for OS (P=0.28) or EFS (P=0.17). Our results suggested that a simple scoring system based on age, blood cell counts and presence of splenomegaly at diagnosis may be used for the long-term prognosis of MPN patients.',\n 'The classical chromosome Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of disorders that share clinical, hematological, and histological features. Proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) are elevated in patients with MPN. The aim of this study was to verify the association between the polymorphisms of TNF gene (-308G/A and -238 G/A) in BCR-ABL-negative MPN in our population. Blood samples obtained from MPN patients were genotyped for the JAK2V617F mutation and both TNF polymorphisms using PCR-RFLP. Thirty three (26.8%) patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 35 (28.7%) essential thrombocythemia (ET), 22 (17.7%) primary myelofibrosis (PMF), and 33 (26.8%) with unclassifiable MPN (MPNu) were included in the study. The JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 94 (76.42%) patients. Were observed a significant increase on the frequency of the TNF-238 GA genotype in MPN patients compared to controls (OR=2.21, 95% CI=1.02-4.80, P<0.04). The distribution of the genotypes and allelic frequencies of TNF-308 was significantly different among the MPNs, JAK2V617F positive, PV and PMF, and controls. Our data has demonstrated that the polymorphisms on TNF-238 GA, TNF-308 GA were associated to MPN development in this population, triggered by JAK2 V617F mutation. ',\n 'The 2001/2008 World Health Organization (WHO)-based diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently revised to accomodate new information on disease-specific mutations and underscore distinguishing morphologic features. In this context, it seems to be reasonable to compare first major diagnostic criteria of the former WHO classifications for myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and then to focus on details that have been discussed and will be proposed for the upcoming revision of diagnostic guidelines. In PV, a characteristic bone marrow (BM) morphology was added as one of three major diagnostic criteria, which allowed lowering of the hemoglobin/hematocrit threshold for diagnosis, which is another major criterion, to 16.5\\u2009g/dl/49% in men and 16\\u2009g/dl/48% in women. The presence of a JAK2 mutation remains the third major diagnostic criterion in PV. Subnormal serum erythropoietin level is now the only minor criterion in PV and is used to capture JAK2-unmutated cases. In ET and PMF, mutations that are considered to confirm clonality and specific diagnosis now include CALR, in addition to JAK2 and MPL. Also in the 2015 discussed revision, overtly fibrotic PMF is clearly distinguished from early/prefibrotic PMF and each PMF variant now includes a separate list of diagnostic criteria. The main rationale for these changes was to enhance the distinction between so-called masked PV and JAK2-mutated ET and between ET and prefibrotic early PMF. The proposed changes also underscore the complementary role, as well as limitations of mutation analysis in morphologic diagnosis. On the other hand, discovery of new biological markers may probably be expected in the future to enhance discrimination of the different MPN subtypes in accordance with the histological BM patterns and corresponding clinical features. ',\n 'BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) include polycythemia Vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primitive myelofibrosis (PMF). the JAK2 V617F mutation has been introduced since 2008 as a major diagnostic criterion on the one hand and on the other hand, it would be linked to increased risk of thrombotic complications.\\nThis study aimed to evaluate the association of JAK2 mutation and thrombotic events in MPN.\\nA retrospective study concerning 45 BCR-ABL negative MPN patients (mean age=53 old years, sex ratio=0.8) was conducted.\\nThey were classified as PV (22 patients), ET (17 patients), PMF (3 patients) and atypical MPN (3 patients). The JAK2 mutation was found in 64.4% of patients: 72.7% of PV patients, 47% of ET patients and 66.7% of PMF patients. Thrombotic events were recorded in 11 patients (24.4%). Cerebral arteries and portal vein were the most frequent localizations. The JAK2 mutation was an independent risk factor of thrombotic events.\\nConsequently, it seems that screening for JAK2 mutation in BCR-ABL negative MPN could play a role in identifying patients at high risk of vascular complications.',\n 'To investigate the clinical and laboratorial features of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients treated in our hospital, to analyze the risk factors influancing survival, and to compare several prognostic scoring systems.\\nparameters about clinical and laboratorial features were taken from medical documents at diagnosis, univariate analysis was conducted by Kaplan-Meier method, the survival data were compared with Log-rank test, and a COX model was used for multivariate analyses.\\nIn our center the anemia and JAK2V617F mutation were more common, while the abnormal karyotype was less common, the constitutional symptoms, splenomegaly, Hb level < 100 g/L and LDH are adverse factors for survival in univariate analysis. Constitutional symptoms and Plt count < 100 × 10(9)/L are adverse factors of survival according to multivariate analysis.\\nThe anemia is more frequent in Chinese patients. Constitutional symptoms and Plt count < 100 × 10(9)/L are independent risk factors for survival. LILLI, modified IPSS, modified DIPSS are suitable to our data.',\n \"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders characterized by increased production of mature blood cells. Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPNs (Ph-MPNs) consist of polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). A number of stem cell derived mutations have been identified in the past 10 years. These findings showed that JAK2V617F, as a diagnostic marker involving JAK2 exon 14 with a high frequency, is the best molecular characterization of Ph-MPNs. Somatic mutations in an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, named calreticulin (CALR), is the second most common mutation in patients with ET and PMF after JAK2 V617F mutation. Discovery of CALR mutations led to the increased molecular diagnostic of ET and PMF up to 90%. It has been shown that JAK2V617F is not the unique event in disease pathogenesis. Some other genes' location such as TET oncogene family member 2 (TET2), additional sex combs-like 1 (ASXL1), casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene (CBL), isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/IDH2), IKAROS family zinc finger 1 (IKZF1), DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), tumor protein p53 (TP53), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) have also identified to be involved in MPNs phenotypes. Here, current molecular biology and genetic mechanisms involved in MNPs with a focus on the aforementioned factors is presented. \",\n 'Treatment for the majority of patients with myelofibrosis is primarily based on symptom control as curative allogeneic stem cell transplantation is typically offered only to younger patients, especially those with poor prognosis disease. Around 50% of patients with myelofibrosis have the JAK2(V617F) mutation, but almost all patients have aberrant activation of the JAK-STAT signalling pathway. Recent efforts have focussed on the clinical use of JAK2 inhibitors to treat myelofibrosis. In this article, we present our recommendations for the practical management of myelofibrosis with ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of both JAK1 and JAK2. Ruxolitinib can significantly improve the quality of life of patients with myelofibrosis. There is also increasing evidence of a positive impact on survival. Consistent with the physiological role of JAK signalling the major toxicity of ruxolitinib is cytopenia. Managing cytopenia is key to maximising the therapeutic benefit of ruxolitinib. Further research into the safety of ruxolitinib in patients with thrombocytopenia is warranted, as is its role in special subgroups of patients, such as those undergoing stem cell transplantation and those experiencing thrombosis as a major manifestation of myelofibrosis. ',\n 'The BCR-ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal stem cell derived malignancies, which include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and myelofibrosis (MF). The MPNs are characterized by dysregulated JAK-STAT signaling pathways. PV and ET are associated with an increased risk of thrombo-hemorrhagic complications, risk of progression to MF and leukemia. Presentation of patients with PV and ET is variable and usually as a result of abnormal full blood count indices (raised hemoglobin and hematocrit, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis). Presentation with thrombosis or splenomegaly occurs in ~30% of patients. Historically thought of as indolent compared with MF, patients with PV and ET have significant disease symptom burden which does not directly correlate to the current clinical prognostic classifications. The mainstay of therapy is reserved for patients with high-risk disease and thus excludes a population of patients with significant symptom related morbidity impacting their quality-of-life and survival. Recent treatment strategies have aimed to incorporate disease burden assessment into the selection of therapeutic interventions such as JAK2 inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors. We will review the advances in the field of MPN symptom assessment and symptom burden experienced by ET and PV patients. We will also discuss the risk-stratified management of ET and PV patients alongside symptom assessment and the impact of potential novel therapies, for patients who fail to respond to conventional treatment.',\n 'Myelofibrosis (MF) is complex at the pathobiologic level and heterogeneous at the clinical level. The advances in molecular characterization of MF provide important insight into the mechanisms driving this chronic myeloid malignancy, refine risk stratification, offer novel therapeutic targets, and serve to measure therapeutic response. Although JAK2 inhibition has been the focus of laboratory and clinical efforts over the last decade, current experimental therapeutic approaches have broadened to include inhibitors of key alternative signaling pathways, epigenetic modulators, anti-fibrotics, and immunotherapies. Based on compelling preclinical rationale, a number of JAK2 inhibitor based combination therapies are now actively being evaluated in the clinic with the goal of disease course modification. The role and timing of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for MF has been challenged with the availability of commercial ruxolitinib and the plethora of experimental treatment options that exist. Integration of preconditioning JAK2 inhibition, reduced intensity conditioning regimens, and alternative donor sources are all being explored in an attempt to optimize this potentially curative modality. This review will summarize modern MF risk stratification, current clinical research approaches to chronic and advance phase MF focusing on novel agents alone and in combination, and update the reader on new directions in HSCT. ',\n 'Primary idiopathic myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal Ph-chromosome negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by dysregulated kinase signaling and release of abnormal cytokines. In the recent past, following JAK2 V617F mutation invention, important revolution has been made in the molecular diagnostic biology of this disease. The rational of this study was to determine the mutational status of JAK2 V617F in Pakistan patients with PMF.\\nIn this cross sectional study, 20 patients with PMF were enrolled from January 2011 to December 2014. Diagnosis was based on WHO criteria for PMF. All patients were screened for G-T point mutation (V617F) in the JAK2 gene on chromosome 9 by allele specific PCR.\\nThe mean age was 57.9 ± 16.5 years. The male to female ratio was 3:1. The frequency of JAK2 V617F positivity in our PMF patients was found to be 55%. Positive correlations of JAK2 V617F mutation were established with high TLC count, raised LDH and marked splenomegaly (P<0.05). No correlation of JAK2 V617F could be established with age and gender (P>0.05).\\nThe JAK2 V617F mutation frequency in our PMF patients was similar to those reported previously. In our hands JAK2 V617F mutated patients expressed an aggressive disease phenotype. Screening for the mutation in all suspected PMF cases could be beneficial in differentiating patients with reactive and clonal marrow fibrosis.',\n 'Detection of chromosomal abnormalities in myeloproliferative disorders is important for proper diagnosis of these disorders. This study has investigated the presence of JAK2 mutation (V617F) in Egyptian patients with myeloproliferative disorders referred to National Cancer institute, Cairo University.\\nThe study involved 110 cases of Philadelphia negative Myeloproliferative diseases (MPDs), 70 cases with Polycythemia Vera (PV), 24 cases with Essential Thrombocytosis (ET) and 16 cases with Idiopathic Myelofibrosis (IMF) and 20 cases as a control group which represented as; (10 cases with secondary erythrocytosis, 1 case with reactive thrombocytosis, 4 cases as normal control and 5 as Philadelphia positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cases), they were collected from National Cancer Institute (NCI) over 3 years. We used ARMS technique for mutation detection.\\nThe frequency of the V617F JAK2 mutation was highest in patients with PV where 56 out of 70 cases (80%) carried the mutation, followed by ET with 6 of 24 (25) and IMF with 2 of 16 (12.5%) . None of the cases with secondary Erythrocytosis, reactive thrombocytosis, the normal controls or Philadelphia positive CML cases carried the mutation.\\nOur results are concordant with international published results for detection of this mutation. It is unequivocal now that V617F is met in many MPDs especially PRV. Finding this mutation in those patients is thought to have a big impact on the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders.',\n 'Frameshift mutations in the calreticulin (CALR) gene are seen in about 30% of essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis patients. To address the contribution of the CALR mutants to the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms, we engrafted lethally irradiated recipient mice with bone marrow cells transduced with retroviruses expressing these mutants. In contrast to wild-type CALR, CALRdel52 (type I) and, to a lesser extent, CALRins5 (type II) induced thrombocytosis due to a megakaryocyte (MK) hyperplasia. Disease was transplantable into secondary recipients. After 6 months, CALRdel52-, in contrast to rare CALRins5-, transduced mice developed a myelofibrosis associated with a splenomegaly and a marked osteosclerosis. Monitoring of virus-transduced populations indicated that CALRdel52 leads to expansion at earlier stages of hematopoiesis than CALRins5. However, both mutants still specifically amplified the MK lineage and platelet production. Moreover, a mutant deleted of the entire exon 9 (CALRdelex9) did not induce a disease, suggesting that the oncogenic property of CALR mutants was related to the new C-terminus peptide. To understand how the CALR mutants target the MK lineage, we used a cell-line model and demonstrated that the CALR mutants, but not CALRdelex9, specifically activate the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor (MPL) to induce constitutive activation of Janus kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5/3/1. We confirmed in c-mpl- and tpo-deficient mice that expression of Mpl, but not of Tpo, was essential for the CALR mutants to induce thrombocytosis in vivo, although Tpo contributes to disease penetrance. Thus, CALR mutants are sufficient to induce thrombocytosis through MPL activation. ',\n None,\n 'Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, myeloproliferation, extramedullary hematopoiesis, splenomegaly and leukemic progression. Moreover, the bone marrow and spleens of individuals with PMF contain large numbers of atypical megakaryocytes that are postulated to contribute to fibrosis through the release of cytokines, including transforming growth factor (TGF)-β. Although the Janus kinase inhibitor ruxolitinib provides symptomatic relief, it does not reduce the mutant allele burden or substantially reverse fibrosis. Here we show through pharmacologic and genetic studies that aurora kinase A (AURKA) represents a new therapeutic target in PMF. Treatment with MLN8237, a selective AURKA inhibitor, promoted polyploidization and differentiation of megakaryocytes with PMF-associated mutations and had potent antifibrotic and antitumor activity in vivo in mouse models of PMF. Moreover, heterozygous deletion of Aurka was sufficient to ameliorate fibrosis and other PMF features in vivo. Our data suggest that megakaryocytes drive fibrosis in PMF and that targeting them with AURKA inhibitors has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit. ',\n \"Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis are collectively known as 'Philadelphia-negative classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs).' The discovery of new genetic aberrations such as Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of MPNs. Currently, the JAK2 mutation is not only a standard criterion for diagnosis but is also a new target for drug development. The JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, was the first JAK inhibitor approved for patients with intermediate- to high-risk myelofibrosis and its effects in improving symptoms and survival benefits were demonstrated by randomized controlled trials. In 2011, the Korean Society of Hematology MPN Working Party devised diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for Korean MPN patients. Subsequently, other genetic mutations have been discovered and many kinds of new drugs are now under clinical investigation. In view of recent developments, we have revised the guidelines for the diagnosis and management of MPN based on published evidence and the experiences of the expert panel. Here we describe the epidemiology, new genetic mutations, and novel therapeutic options as well as diagnostic criteria and standard treatment strategies for MPN patients in Korea. \",\n 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a heterogeneous group of clonal diseases characterized by the excessive and chronic production of mature cells from one or several of the myeloid lineages. Recent advances in the biology of MPNs have greatly facilitated their molecular diagnosis since most patients present with mutation(s) in the JAK2, MPL, or CALR genes. Yet the roles played by these mutations in the pathogenesis and main complications of the different subtypes of MPNs are not fully elucidated. Importantly, chronic inflammation has long been associated with MPN disease and some of the symptoms and complications can be linked to inflammation. Moreover, the JAK inhibitor clinical trials showed that the reduction of symptoms linked to inflammation was beneficial to patients even in the absence of significant decrease in the JAK2-V617F mutant load. These observations suggested that part of the inflammation observed in patients with JAK2-mutated MPNs may not be the consequence of JAK2 mutation. The aim of this paper is to review the different aspects of inflammation in MPNs, the molecular mechanisms involved, the role of specific genetic defects, and the evidence that increased production of certain cytokines depends or not on MPN-associated mutations, and to discuss possible nongenetic causes of inflammation. ',\n 'In 2008, WHO made the JAK2V617F gene mutation as one of the specific molecular diagnostic markers of BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). In 2013 two research teams demonstrated that whole genome sequencing technology (WGS) was used to detect calreticulin gene mutation in essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patients with JAK2V617F⁻ and MPL⁻ mutations. In this review, the relationship of CALR gene mutation with MPN is briefly summarized.',\n 'To establish the primary myelofibrosis (PMF)-induced pluripotent stem cell line (iPSC) by means of iPSC techinique so as to provide a experimental model for studying the blood disease mechanisms.\\nInduced pluripotent stem cells were generated from mononuclear cells isolated from a PMF patient with JAK2(V617F) mutation by using episomal vectors.\\nPMF-derived iPSC was established from the patient with JAK2(V617F) gene mutation. The PMF-iPSC could be stably passaged, highly expressed pluripotent genes as human embryonic stem (ES) cells, and were able to form teratoma in NOD/SCID mice in vivo. H & E staining of the teratoma showed the presence of tissue type derived from all three embryonic germ layers. Sanger sequencing confirmed that PMF-derived iPSC carried different allele burdens of JAK2(V617F) gene mutation.\\nThe interation-free iPSC from primary myelofibrosis patient in vitro has been established. This PMF-derived iPSC line provides a valuable tool for studying the pathogenesis, screening of chimical drugs and realizing the standard therapy of PMF.',\n 'In most patients, lung cancer presents as advanced disease with metastases to lymph nodes and/or distant organs, and survival is poor. Lung cancer is also a highly immune-suppressing malignancy with numerous methods to evade antitumor immune responses, including deficiencies in antigen processing and presentation, release of immunomodulatory cytokines, and inhibition of T-cell activation. Advances in understanding the complex interactions of the immune system and cancer have led to novel therapies that promote T-cell activation at the tumor site, resulting in prolonged clinical benefit. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically programmed death receptor 1 pathway antibodies, have demonstrated impressively durable responses and improved survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This article will review the recent progress made in immunotherapy for lung cancer with data from trials evaluating programmed death receptor 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 monoclonal antibodies in addition to cancer vaccines. The review will focus on studies that have been published and the latest randomized trials exploring immune therapy in lung cancer. These results form the framework for a new direction in the treatment of lung cancer toward immunotherapy. ',\n 'The immune effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are poorly understood. Identifying immune biomarkers could guide patient selection and optimisation of EGFR-TKI-immunotherapy combinations.\\n33 patients with NSCLC treated with an EGFR-TKI were prospectively enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected pre-treatment, and after 1, 3 and 8 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to identify immune cell subsets, including PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing T cells. Immune parameters were correlated with clinical outcomes.\\nCompared to healthy donors (n=10), patients had higher pre-treatment proportions of proliferating and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p<0.001). Compared to patients with an EGFR mutation (n=12), patients without a known mutation (n=21) had higher proportions of proliferating CD4(+) and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p=0.03). There was a significant increase in PD-L1(+) T cells after 1 week of EGFR-TKI in patients whose disease progressed compared to non-progressors. Patients with higher PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells at 1-week were more likely to progress (OR 30.3, p<0.01) and had shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 8.8m; p<0.01) and OS (3.8 vs 23.2m; p<0.001) than those with fewer PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells. On multivariate analysis, high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells was the only independent predictor for PFS (HR 3.7, p=0.01), while for OS independent predictors were high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (HR 6.5, p<0.01) and EGFR-negative status (HR 3.3, p=0.04).\\nThere was a significant correlation between PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells and clinical outcomes in EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC. This warrants further validation as a blood-based biomarker that may identify candidates for PD-1 inhibitors or immunotherapy-EGFR-TKI combinations.',\n 'The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is expressed by activated T-cells and engaged by ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 normally expressed by infiltrating immune cells in response to viral infection. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is a negative inhibitory pathway that down-regulates T-cells but is also used by tumors to evade anti-tumor immunity. Antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 axis are capable of restoring functional anti-tumor immunity and have demonstrated efficacy in a broad range of tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer in both squamous and adenocarcinoma histologies. Ongoing issues affecting clinical development of these agents include assessment of response, optimal duration of therapy in excellent responders, predictive biomarkers and mechanisms of resistance. In this report, we describe a patient with advanced KRAS mutant heavily pretreated pulmonary adenocarcinoma who developed an excellent response after a single-dose of nivolumab. Pre-treatment tumor was found to have moderate CD3 and PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemical staining. Evaluation of exceptional responders and non-responders are critical to furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of action (and resistance) to these agents. ',\n 'Targeted therapies and immunotherapies have quickly become fixtures in the treatment armamentarium for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, and ROS-1 rearrangements have demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS) and, in selected populations, improved overall survival (OS) compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have now also demonstrated improved survival compared with chemotherapy. The use of these novel systemic agents in non-metastatic patient populations and in combination with radiation therapy is not well defined. As radiation therapy has become more effective and more conformal with fewer toxicities, it has increasingly been used in the oligometastatic or oligoprogression setting. This has allowed improvement in PFS and potentially OS, and in the oligoprogressive setting may overcome acquired drug resistance of a specific lesion(s) to allow patients to remain on their targeted therapies. Molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies for patients with metastatic NSCLC have demonstrated much success. Advances in radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiation therapy have led to combination strategies with targeted therapies among patients with lung cancer. Radiation therapy has also been combined with immunotherapies predominantly in the metastatic setting. In the metastatic population, radiation therapy has the ability to provide durable local control and also augment the immune response of systemic agents, which may lead to an abscopal effect of immune-mediated tumor response in disease sites outside of the radiation field in select patients. ',\n 'The development of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab and its approval in 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has heralded a new era in immuno-oncology. Subsequently, novel agents against the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis have shown significant activity in melanoma and a variety of other tumor types. Pembrolizumab was the first anti-PD-1 antibody to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab, and if BRAF (V600) mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Pembrolizumab has also received breakthrough status for the treatment of EGFR mutation-negative, ALK rearrangement-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy. There remain a number of pivotal trials in progress to further evaluate the optimal use of pembrolizumab alone and in combination for melanoma, NSCLC, and other tumor types. In this article, we review the efficacy and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab and evaluate its future development. ',\n 'Therapeutic antibodies to programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 show promising clinical results. Anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) may be a biomarker to select patients more likely to respond to these treatments. However, the development of at least four different therapeutics, each with a different anti-PD-L1 IHC assay, has raised concerns among pathologists and oncologists alike. This article reviews existing data on the IHC biomarker aspects of studies using these drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and considers the challenges ahead, should these drug/IHC assay combinations reach routine practice. For each the known biomarker assays in development, there is a different monoclonal IHC antibody clone, produced by one of two diagnostics companies. Each test requires proprietary staining platforms and uses different definitions of a \"positive\" test for PD-L1 expression, on tumor cells and, in one test, also on tumor infiltrating immune cells. There are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of the technical aspects of these tests, and of the biological implications and associations of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC, considering heterogeneity of expression, dynamic changes in expression, and prognostic implications among other factors. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee raises the prospect of trying not only to harmonize and standardize testing for PD-L1 by IHC, at least at a technical level, but also, ideally, as a predictive marker, to facilitate availability of this test and a promising treatment for patients with NSCLC. ',\n 'After years of limited success, progress of anti-cancer immuno-therapeutics has been considerable over the past decade. Key to this progress has been the application of new biological insights around the importance and nature of immune checkpoints that are able to reverse down-regulation of anti-tumor immunity.\\nAn overview of the preclinical and recent clinical trial data on key immuno-regulatory agents currently in development, including antibody targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes and its principal ligand (PD-L1) on tumor cells as well as immune agonists (e.g., anti-CD40).\\nDurable long-term responses in some patients with advanced melanoma, initially with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and more recently antibodies targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 in patients with melanoma and renal cancer, non-small-cell lung, bladder and head and neck cancers with less toxicity, have provided real optimism that immunotherapeutic approaches can improve outcomes in a wide range of cancer. The manageable tolerability of PD-1-pathway blockers and their unique mechanism of action are encouraging combination approaches. Current efforts focus on registration trials of single agents plus combinations in many different tumor types and treatment settings and identifying and developing predictive biomarkers of immunological response.',\n 'Non-small-cell lung cancer usually carries a dismal prognosis. Novel treatment approaches are clearly warranted. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising area of research developing agents that manipulate the immune system to induce antitumor responses while avoiding major toxicity. New vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors are currently undergoing investigation in phase II and phase III clinical trials. In advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), belagenpumatucel-L, an allogeneic cell vaccine directed against transforming growth factor β in the tumor microenvironment, knocks down the immune suppression caused by the tumor and has demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent efficacy in some subgroups of patients. L-BLP25 and TG4010 are both antigenic vaccines that target mucin 1, whose encoding proto-oncogene is commonly mutated in solid tumors. The L-BLP25 vaccine achieved a significant improvement in overall survival in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy. TG4010 vaccination resulted in better progression-free survival when added to cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results are being addressed in the currently ongoing phase III TIME trial. In the adjuvant setting, MAGE-A3, an antigen-based vaccine, showed promising results in melanoma-associated antigen A3 positive lung cancer patients who underwent resection in the phase II study; however, no improvement in progression-free survival was observed in the phase III MAGRIT study. CIMAVax is a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) vaccine that induces anti-EGF antibody production and prevents EGF from binding to its receptor. It has improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who achieve seroconversion. Ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, demonstrated improved progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC patients who received the drug after chemotherapy in a phased regimen. Finally, anti-programmed death receptor 1 agents have achieved durable response rates in phase I studies. This review gives an overview of the current data and the most promissory immunotherapeutic agents for NSCLC. ',\n 'Epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR 1 ) is a 170-kd glycoprotein that plays many roles in the growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are four known receptors in the EGFR family. Binding of a ligand such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) causes EGFR to undergo a conformational change leading to autophosphorylation of EGFR and activation of the EGFR growth factor pathway. The protein products of the genes that are then expressed increase cell proliferation and angiogenesis and inhibit programmed cell death. EGFR is expressed in 40% to 80% of NSCLC. EGFR tyrosine kinase activity can be inhibited by antibody therapy, such as cetuximab, against the extracellular domain of EGFR or small-molecule therapy, such as gefitinib or erlotinib that blocks the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the cytoplasmic domain. Both forms of EGFR inhibition have single-agent antitumor activity against previously treated NSCLC. Interestingly, EGFR expression does not correlate with response to EGFR inhibition therapy. Increased likelihood of responding to small-molecule therapy is associated with female gender, never smoking, adenocarcinoma, and acquired mutations of the EGFR ATP binding site in tumor cells. In previously treated NSCLC, the small-molecule erlotinib improved both quality of life and median survival as a single agent compared with best supportive care. Southwest Oncology Group 0023 is a large, phase III, randomized trial comparing concurrent chemoradiotherapy and consolidation docetaxel with or without maintenance small-molecule therapy with gefitinib. There is also strong preclinical evidence that EGFR inhibition is additive or synergistic with radiotherapy in NSCLC. In locally advanced head and neck cancer, the addition of cetuximab antibody therapy to radiation increased median survival from 28 to 54 months. Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30106 and a multi-institutional Australian phase I trial have shown that gefitinib can be added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC without excessive toxicity. A phase I trial at the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) has evaluated erlotinib with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0324 is an on-going phase II trial studying cetuximab and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.',\n 'In most patients, lung cancer presents as advanced disease with metastases to lymph nodes and/or distant organs, and survival is poor. Lung cancer is also a highly immune-suppressing malignancy with numerous methods to evade antitumor immune responses, including deficiencies in antigen processing and presentation, release of immunomodulatory cytokines, and inhibition of T-cell activation. Advances in understanding the complex interactions of the immune system and cancer have led to novel therapies that promote T-cell activation at the tumor site, resulting in prolonged clinical benefit. Immune checkpoint inhibitors, specifically programmed death receptor 1 pathway antibodies, have demonstrated impressively durable responses and improved survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This article will review the recent progress made in immunotherapy for lung cancer with data from trials evaluating programmed death receptor 1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 monoclonal antibodies in addition to cancer vaccines. The review will focus on studies that have been published and the latest randomized trials exploring immune therapy in lung cancer. These results form the framework for a new direction in the treatment of lung cancer toward immunotherapy. ',\n 'The immune effects of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are poorly understood. Identifying immune biomarkers could guide patient selection and optimisation of EGFR-TKI-immunotherapy combinations.\\n33 patients with NSCLC treated with an EGFR-TKI were prospectively enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected pre-treatment, and after 1, 3 and 8 weeks. Flow cytometry was used to identify immune cell subsets, including PD-1 and PD-L1 expressing T cells. Immune parameters were correlated with clinical outcomes.\\nCompared to healthy donors (n=10), patients had higher pre-treatment proportions of proliferating and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p<0.001). Compared to patients with an EGFR mutation (n=12), patients without a known mutation (n=21) had higher proportions of proliferating CD4(+) and PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (p=0.03). There was a significant increase in PD-L1(+) T cells after 1 week of EGFR-TKI in patients whose disease progressed compared to non-progressors. Patients with higher PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells at 1-week were more likely to progress (OR 30.3, p<0.01) and had shorter PFS (1.6 vs. 8.8m; p<0.01) and OS (3.8 vs 23.2m; p<0.001) than those with fewer PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells. On multivariate analysis, high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells was the only independent predictor for PFS (HR 3.7, p=0.01), while for OS independent predictors were high PD-L1(+)CD3(+) T cells (HR 6.5, p<0.01) and EGFR-negative status (HR 3.3, p=0.04).\\nThere was a significant correlation between PD-L1 expression on peripheral T cells and clinical outcomes in EGFR-TKI-treated NSCLC. This warrants further validation as a blood-based biomarker that may identify candidates for PD-1 inhibitors or immunotherapy-EGFR-TKI combinations.',\n 'The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is expressed by activated T-cells and engaged by ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 normally expressed by infiltrating immune cells in response to viral infection. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is a negative inhibitory pathway that down-regulates T-cells but is also used by tumors to evade anti-tumor immunity. Antibodies targeting PD-1/PD-L1 axis are capable of restoring functional anti-tumor immunity and have demonstrated efficacy in a broad range of tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer in both squamous and adenocarcinoma histologies. Ongoing issues affecting clinical development of these agents include assessment of response, optimal duration of therapy in excellent responders, predictive biomarkers and mechanisms of resistance. In this report, we describe a patient with advanced KRAS mutant heavily pretreated pulmonary adenocarcinoma who developed an excellent response after a single-dose of nivolumab. Pre-treatment tumor was found to have moderate CD3 and PD-L1 positivity by immunohistochemical staining. Evaluation of exceptional responders and non-responders are critical to furthering our understanding of the mechanisms of action (and resistance) to these agents. ',\n 'Targeted therapies and immunotherapies have quickly become fixtures in the treatment armamentarium for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Targeted therapies directed against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocations, and ROS-1 rearrangements have demonstrated improved progression free survival (PFS) and, in selected populations, improved overall survival (OS) compared with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitor monoclonal antibodies against programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), have now also demonstrated improved survival compared with chemotherapy. The use of these novel systemic agents in non-metastatic patient populations and in combination with radiation therapy is not well defined. As radiation therapy has become more effective and more conformal with fewer toxicities, it has increasingly been used in the oligometastatic or oligoprogression setting. This has allowed improvement in PFS and potentially OS, and in the oligoprogressive setting may overcome acquired drug resistance of a specific lesion(s) to allow patients to remain on their targeted therapies. Molecularly targeted therapies and immunotherapies for patients with metastatic NSCLC have demonstrated much success. Advances in radiation therapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy, radiation therapy have led to combination strategies with targeted therapies among patients with lung cancer. Radiation therapy has also been combined with immunotherapies predominantly in the metastatic setting. In the metastatic population, radiation therapy has the ability to provide durable local control and also augment the immune response of systemic agents, which may lead to an abscopal effect of immune-mediated tumor response in disease sites outside of the radiation field in select patients. ',\n 'The development of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 inhibitor ipilimumab and its approval in 2011 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma has heralded a new era in immuno-oncology. Subsequently, novel agents against the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis have shown significant activity in melanoma and a variety of other tumor types. Pembrolizumab was the first anti-PD-1 antibody to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab, and if BRAF (V600) mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. Pembrolizumab has also received breakthrough status for the treatment of EGFR mutation-negative, ALK rearrangement-negative non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that has progressed on or following platinum-based chemotherapy. There remain a number of pivotal trials in progress to further evaluate the optimal use of pembrolizumab alone and in combination for melanoma, NSCLC, and other tumor types. In this article, we review the efficacy and toxicity profile of pembrolizumab and evaluate its future development. ',\n 'Therapeutic antibodies to programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 show promising clinical results. Anti-PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) may be a biomarker to select patients more likely to respond to these treatments. However, the development of at least four different therapeutics, each with a different anti-PD-L1 IHC assay, has raised concerns among pathologists and oncologists alike. This article reviews existing data on the IHC biomarker aspects of studies using these drugs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and considers the challenges ahead, should these drug/IHC assay combinations reach routine practice. For each the known biomarker assays in development, there is a different monoclonal IHC antibody clone, produced by one of two diagnostics companies. Each test requires proprietary staining platforms and uses different definitions of a \"positive\" test for PD-L1 expression, on tumor cells and, in one test, also on tumor infiltrating immune cells. There are still considerable gaps in our knowledge of the technical aspects of these tests, and of the biological implications and associations of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC, considering heterogeneity of expression, dynamic changes in expression, and prognostic implications among other factors. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Pathology Committee raises the prospect of trying not only to harmonize and standardize testing for PD-L1 by IHC, at least at a technical level, but also, ideally, as a predictive marker, to facilitate availability of this test and a promising treatment for patients with NSCLC. ',\n 'After years of limited success, progress of anti-cancer immuno-therapeutics has been considerable over the past decade. Key to this progress has been the application of new biological insights around the importance and nature of immune checkpoints that are able to reverse down-regulation of anti-tumor immunity.\\nAn overview of the preclinical and recent clinical trial data on key immuno-regulatory agents currently in development, including antibody targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) on T-lymphocytes and its principal ligand (PD-L1) on tumor cells as well as immune agonists (e.g., anti-CD40).\\nDurable long-term responses in some patients with advanced melanoma, initially with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and more recently antibodies targeting either PD-1 or PD-L1 in patients with melanoma and renal cancer, non-small-cell lung, bladder and head and neck cancers with less toxicity, have provided real optimism that immunotherapeutic approaches can improve outcomes in a wide range of cancer. The manageable tolerability of PD-1-pathway blockers and their unique mechanism of action are encouraging combination approaches. Current efforts focus on registration trials of single agents plus combinations in many different tumor types and treatment settings and identifying and developing predictive biomarkers of immunological response.',\n 'Non-small-cell lung cancer usually carries a dismal prognosis. Novel treatment approaches are clearly warranted. Immunotherapy has emerged as a promising area of research developing agents that manipulate the immune system to induce antitumor responses while avoiding major toxicity. New vaccines and checkpoint inhibitors are currently undergoing investigation in phase II and phase III clinical trials. In advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), belagenpumatucel-L, an allogeneic cell vaccine directed against transforming growth factor β in the tumor microenvironment, knocks down the immune suppression caused by the tumor and has demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent efficacy in some subgroups of patients. L-BLP25 and TG4010 are both antigenic vaccines that target mucin 1, whose encoding proto-oncogene is commonly mutated in solid tumors. The L-BLP25 vaccine achieved a significant improvement in overall survival in the subgroup of patients with stage IIIB NSCLC treated with chemoradiotherapy. TG4010 vaccination resulted in better progression-free survival when added to cisplatin-gemcitabine chemotherapy. These results are being addressed in the currently ongoing phase III TIME trial. In the adjuvant setting, MAGE-A3, an antigen-based vaccine, showed promising results in melanoma-associated antigen A3 positive lung cancer patients who underwent resection in the phase II study; however, no improvement in progression-free survival was observed in the phase III MAGRIT study. CIMAVax is a recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF) vaccine that induces anti-EGF antibody production and prevents EGF from binding to its receptor. It has improved overall survival in patients with advanced NSCLC who achieve seroconversion. Ipilimumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4, demonstrated improved progression-free survival in advanced NSCLC patients who received the drug after chemotherapy in a phased regimen. Finally, anti-programmed death receptor 1 agents have achieved durable response rates in phase I studies. This review gives an overview of the current data and the most promissory immunotherapeutic agents for NSCLC. ',\n 'Epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR 1 ) is a 170-kd glycoprotein that plays many roles in the growth of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are four known receptors in the EGFR family. Binding of a ligand such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) causes EGFR to undergo a conformational change leading to autophosphorylation of EGFR and activation of the EGFR growth factor pathway. The protein products of the genes that are then expressed increase cell proliferation and angiogenesis and inhibit programmed cell death. EGFR is expressed in 40% to 80% of NSCLC.

A phase I trial at the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) has evaluated erlotinib with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC. Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0324 is an on-going phase II trial studying cetuximab and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.',\n 'The ',\n 'Sex hormones and their receptors play critical roles in the genesis and progression of breast and prostate cancers. We recently discovered that sex hormone signaling pathways promote the expression of specific tRNA halves termed Sex HOrmone-dependent TRNA-derived RNAs (SHOT-RNAs). Functional involvement of SHOT-RNAs in cell proliferation suggests a novel tRNA-engaged pathway in tumorigenesis. ',\n 'Stress response mediator activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) engages in diverse oncogenic pathways including the androgen receptor signaling essential for prostatic proliferation. In line with frequent downregulation of ATF3 expression in human prostate cancers, we have provided the first genetic evidence supporting the role of ATF3 as a tumor suppressor in a subset of prostate cancers with PTEN dysfunction. ',\n 'To verify whether FN1 and ZNF438 are the androgen receptor(AR) target genes in LNCaP-AI cells and investigate the effects of AR exerts on FN1 and ZNF438 gene expression.\\nChIP-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed to verify the fact that AR acted on FN1 and ZNF438 gene. Subsequently, LNCaP-AI cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone(DHT)and lentivirus transfection to down-regulate AR expression. The expression of FN1 and ZNF438 gene in mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by RT-qPCR and Western blot.\\nFN1 and ZNF438 gene enrichment of AR-ChIP group were 7.274±0.290 and 6.843±0.078, significantly higher than the IgG-ChIP group of 1.004±0.113 and 1.000±0.014 (t(FN1)=34.91, t(ZNF438)=128.377, P<0.05). Differences were statistical significance. After DHT stimulation, the expression of FN1 and ZNF438 gene in mRNA and protein levels were 0.434±0.050 and 0.069±0.042, significantly lower than the control group of 1.000±0.016 and 1.025±0.277 (t(FN1)=18.532, t(ZNF438)=5.905, P<0.05). Differences were statistical significance. Moreover, after AR down-regulation, the expression of FN1 and ZNF438 gene in mRNA and protein levels were 17.579±4.415 and 1.895±0.424, significantly higher than the control group of 1.028±0.445 and 1.041±0.190 (t(FN1)=6.461, t(ZNF438)=3.184, P<0.05). Differences were statistical significance.\\nFN1 and ZNF438 gene are AR negatively regulated target genes in LNCaP-AI cells. The study might provide a new sight to further explore the mechanism of LNCaP-AI cells grow in androgen-depleted conditions.',\n 'Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cancer in men. The Androgen Receptor (AR) is the major driver of PCa and the main target of therapy in the advanced setting. AR is a nuclear receptor that binds the chromatin and regulates transcription of genes involved in cancer cell proliferation and survival. In a study by Stelloo et al. (1) we explored prostate cancer on the level of transcriptional regulation by means of Formaldehyde-Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled with massive parallel sequencing (FAIRE-seq and ChIP-seq, respectively). We employed these data for the assessment of differences in transcriptional regulation at distinct stages of PCa progression and to construct a prognostic gene expression classifier. Genomics data includes FAIRE-seq data from normal prostate tissue as well as primary, hormone therapy resistant and metastatic PCa. Furthermore, ChIP-seq data from primary and resistant PCa were generated, along with multiple input controls. The data are publicly available through NCBI GEO database with accession number GSE65478. Here we describe the genomics and clinical data in detail and provide comparative analysis of FAIRE-seq and ChIP-seq data. ',\n None,\n 'The androgen receptor is the main therapeutic target that has been successfully exploited through direct inhibition to extend survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We present a patient who participated in a Phase II study of an antagonist antibody to insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) in men with mCRPC and experienced over five years of stable disease.\\xa0His disease was rapidly progressing before exposure to the antibody and resumed its aggressive behavior following discontinuation of therapy, strongly supporting the attribution of his stable disease to IGF-1R inhibition. His pre-treatment biopsy exhibited increased protein expression of IGF-1R (and its downstream effector, phosphorylated-S6). Consequently, agents that target IGF-1R may provide profound and durable responses in a subset of patients and upfront molecular selection may enable us to identify those most likely to benefit. ',\n 'To study the regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells by triptolide (TP) and the possible mechanism, by using qRT-PCR and Western blot, the AR mRNA and protein levels in TP treated LNCaP cells were detected, and the AR protein level in TP and NF-κB inhibitor treated LNCaP cells was also detected; a series of pGL3-AR promoter reporter gene vectors were built using restriction-free cloning method, and the vectors were employed to investigate the effects of TP on the transcriptional activity of AR promoter in LNCaP cells; the upstream proteins which may play regulatory roles were detected using western blot assay. After treated LNCaP cells with TP for 48 h, AR mRNA and protein expressions decreased with increasing TP concentration. The expression of AR target gene PART1 and prostate specific antigen (PSA) was also downregulated by TP treatment; a series of pGL3-AR promoter reporter vectors were constructed and validated by sequencing and luciferase activity; the results of dual luciferase reporter assay showed that TP downregulated AR at the transcriptional level; PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway which is associated with AR promoter activity was drowregulated by TP. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of AR in LNCAP cells was downregulated by TP, and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway may be involved in the regulation mechanism.',\n 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a progressive, noncurable disease induced by androgen receptor (AR) upon its activation by tumor tissue androgen, which is generated from adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) through intracrine androgen biosynthesis. Inhibition of mCRPC and early-stage, androgen-dependent prostate cancer by calcitriol, the bioactive vitamin D3 metabolite, is amply documented in cell culture and animal studies. However, clinical trials of calcitriol or synthetic analogs are inconclusive, although encouraging results have recently emerged from pilot studies showing efficacy of a safe-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in reducing tumor tissue inflammation and progression of low-grade prostate cancer. Vitamin D-mediated inhibition of normal and malignant prostate cells is caused by diverse mechanisms including G1/S cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, prodifferentiation gene expression changes, and suppressed angiogenesis and cell migration. Biological effects of vitamin D are mediated by altered expression of a gene network regulated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is a multidomain, ligand-inducible transcription factor similar to AR and other nuclear receptors. AR-VDR cross talk modulates androgen metabolism in prostate cancer cells. Androgen inhibits vitamin D-mediated induction of CYP24A1, the calcitriol-degrading enzyme, while vitamin D promotes androgen inactivation by inducing phase I monooxygenases (e.g., CYP3A4) and phase II transferases (e.g., SULT2B1b, a DHEA-sulfotransferase). CYP3A4 and SULT2B1b levels are markedly reduced and CYP24A1 is overexpressed in advanced prostate cancer. In future trials, combining low-calcemic, potent next-generation calcitriol analogs with CYP24A1 inhibition or androgen supplementation, or cancer stem cell suppression by a phytonutrient such as sulfarophane, may prove fruitful in prostate cancer prevention and treatment. ',\n 'The androgen receptor (AR) plays a key role in progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Despite the recent progress in targeting persistent AR activity with the next-generation hormonal therapies (abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide), resistance to these agents limits therapeutic efficacy for many patients. Several explanations for response and/or resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are emerging, but growing interest is focusing on importance of AR splice variants (AR-Vs) and in particular of AR-V7. Increasing evidences highlight the concept that variant expression could be used as a potential predictive biomarker and a therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of treatment resistance or sensitivity can help to achieve a more effective management of mCRPC, increasing clinical outcomes and representing a promising and engaging area of prostate cancer research. ',\n 'Prostate cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and mechanisms of action of taxanes and potential mechanisms of resistance are not clearly defined. Taxanes are microtubule-stabilizing agents resulting in the slowing or blocking of mitosis at the metaphase-anaphase transition and induction of apoptotic cell death. Taxanes also can inhibit androgen receptor pathway. To date, several factors have been associated with taxane resistance, including alterations in tubulin, the effect of drug efflux pumps, and the dysfunctional regulation of signaling pathways that may be involved in resistance to therapy. Preclinical and clinical data support the distinct activity of cabazitaxel in prostate cancer that may overcome resistance to prior taxanes or hormonal therapies. It is challenging to define the most adequate therapeutic sequence for each patient. Moreover, the identification of molecular markers of resistance may help to select patients for specific therapies.',\n 'In vitro studies in prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines have suggested a key and complex role of the store-operated channels (SOCs) in major cancer hallmarks, including proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. In the present study, we investigated in vivo the expression of the SOC components transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) 1, TRPC4, Orai1, and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), during all stages of PCa progression, and evaluated their prognostic impact in clinically localized cancer (CLC). The expressions of TRPC1, TRPC4, Orai1, STIM1, and the androgen receptor and the proliferation marker Ki-67 were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays containing samples of normal prostate tissues (n=91), prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (n=61), CLC surgically treated (n=238), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; n=45). All markers significantly increased in CLC compared with normal tissues and (for Orai1 and STIM1) in advanced pT3 tumors compared with pT2. In contrast, their expression decreased in CRPC, particularly for Orai1. In CLC, staining for TRPC1, Orai1 and STIM1 correlated with androgen receptor expression, and TRPC1 status was associated with lower proliferation and longer recurrence-free survival, after adjusting for classical prognostic markers. Although increased SOC expression during PCa progression supports a role in cancer cell migration, the inverse association between TRPC1 and biochemical relapse suggests a protective effect in CLC. Moreover, the dramatic down-regulation of Orai1 in CRPC supports its role in apoptosis at this stage of the disease. These results call for caution when considering SOCs as potential therapeutic targets for PCa. ',\n 'Prostate cancer (PCa) metastasizes to bone and soft tissues, greatly decreasing quality of life, causing bone pain, skeletal complications, and mortality in PCa patients. While new treatment strategies are being developed, the molecular and cellular basis of PCa metastasis and the \"cross-talk\" between cancer cells and their microenvironment and crucial cell signaling pathways need to be successfully dissected for intervention. In this review, we introduce a new concept of the mechanism of PCa metastasis, the recruitment and reprogramming of bystander and dormant cells (DCs) by a population of metastasis-initiating cells (MICs). We provide evidence that recruited and reprogrammed DCs gain MICs phenotypes and can subsequently metastasize to bone and soft tissues. We show that MICs can also recruit and reprogram circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and this could contribute to cancer cell evolution and the acquisition of therapeutic resistance. We summarize relevant molecular signaling pathways, including androgen receptors (ARs) and their variants and growth factors (GFs) and cytokines that could contribute to the predilection of PCa for homing to bone and soft tissues. To understand the etiology and the biology of PCa and the effectiveness of therapeutic targeting, we briefly summarize the animal and cell models that have been employed. We also report our experience in the use of three-dimensional (3-D) culture and co-culture models to understand cell signaling networks and the use of these attractive tools to conduct drug screening exercises against already-identified molecular targets. Further research into PCa growth and metastasis will improve our ability to target cancer metastasis more effectively and provide better rationales for personalized oncology. ',\n 'The literature suggests that the serum testosterone level required for maximum androgen receptor (AR) binding may be in the range of nanomolar and above this range of concentrations; this sexual hormone may not significantly affect tumour biology. This assumption is supported by clinical studies showing that cell proliferation markers did not change when serum T levels increased after exogenous T treatment in comparison to subjects treated with placebo. However, a considerable part of the global scientific community remains sceptical regarding the use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in men suffering from hypogonadism and prostate cancer (Pca). The negative attitudes with respect to testosterone supplementation in men with hypogonadism and Pca may be justified by the relatively low number of clinical and preclinical studies that specifically dealt with how androgens affect Pca biology. More controversial still is the use of TRT in men in active surveillance or at intermediate or high risk of recurrence and treated by curative radiotherapy. In these clinical scenarios, clinicians should be aware that safety data regarding TRT are scanty limiting our ability to draw definitive conclusions on this important topic. In this review we critically discuss the newest scientific evidence concerning the new challenges in the treatment of men with hypogonadal condition and Pca providing new insights in the pharmacological and psychological approaches. ',\n 'Despite advances in prostate cancer diagnosis and management, morbidity from prostate cancer remains high. Approximately 20% of men present with advanced or metastatic disease, while 29,000 men continue to die of prostate cancer each year. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has been the standard of care for initial management of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer since Huggins and Hodges first introduced the concept of androgen-dependence in 1972, but progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) occurs within 2-3 years of initiation of ADT. CRPC, previously defined as hormone-refractory prostate cancer, is now understood to still be androgen dependent. Multiple mechanisms of resistance help contribute to the progression to castration resistant disease, and the androgen receptor (AR) remains an important driver in this progression. These mechanisms include AR amplification and hypersensitivity, AR mutations leading to promiscuity, mutations in coactivators/corepressors, androgen-independent AR activation, and intratumoral and alternative androgen production. More recently, identification of AR variants (ARVs) has been established as another mechanism of progression to CRPC. Docetaxel chemotherapy has historically been the first-line treatment for CRPC, but in recent years, newer agents have been introduced that target some of these mechanisms of resistance, thereby providing additional survival benefit. These include AR signaling inhibitors such as enzalutamide (Xtandi, ENZA, MDV-3100) and CYP17A1 inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate (Zytiga). Ultimately, these agents will also fail to suppress CRPC. While some of the mechanisms by which these agents fail are unique, many share similarities to the mechanisms contributing to CRPC progression. Understanding these mechanisms of resistance to ADT and currently approved CRPC treatments will help guide future research into targeted therapies. ',\n 'TCF3 (E2A) is a multifunctional basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor that is over-expressed in prostate cancer (PCa) as compared to normal prostate and that it acts as a tumor promoter in PCa. Given the diverse biological pathways regulated/influenced by TCF3, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate its expression. TCF3 expression in androgen sensitive LNCaP and insensitive C81 PCa cell lines was determined following treatments with androgen receptor (AR) agonist R1881 and antagonist Casodex. In silico analysis was used to discover putative Androgen Response Elements (ARE) in the TCF3 promoter/intron region. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with AR antibody and luciferase reporter assays on the above mentioned cell lines was used to confirm AR biding and AR dependent transcriptional activity respectively. The results were confirmed by demonstrating TCF3 expression in LNCaP PCa xenograft models. The results suggested that TCF3 transcript increased in response to R1881 in LNCaP cells but was constitutively expressed in C-81 cell lines. The promoter/Intron region of the TCF3 gene was predicted to contain two putative ARE sites ARE1 and ARE2. ChIP after treatment of LNCaP and C81 cells with R1881 and Casodex showed that the ARE1 and ARE2 were bound by AR in LNCaP cells only in the presence of R1881, whereas C81 cells showed constitutive AR binding. Similar results were observed in luciferase reporter assays indicating that TCF3 is activated by AR in LNCaP cell lines whereas it is independent of androgens in C81 cell line. Luciferase reporter assays also confirmed that ARE1 alone drives androgen dependent transcription. TCF3 expression was only observed in castration resistant LNCaP xenografts in castrated mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in PCa androgen receptor regulates the expression of TCF3 which is mediated in part via a consensus androgen response element. The shift in TCF3 expression from androgen regulated to androgen independent during prostate cancer progression, together with lack of expression in normal prostate may provide mechanistic basis underlying the transition of androgen receptor from a tumor suppressor to an oncogene in prostate cancer. ',\n 'The most common type of prostate cancer is acinar adenocarcinoma, which is androgen-dependent and, therefore, treated with chemical or surgical castration and androgen receptor inhibition. However, the disease usually progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). A neuroendocrine pattern is frequently observed in the cellular composition of CRPC, which is considered to emerge as an effect of androgen deprivation therapy. This is the case report of a 69-year-old patient with prostate adenocarcinoma, who, after an initial period of disease control with radiotherapy and antiandrogens, was diagnosed with CRPC with high levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), unresponsive to androgen inhibition, with accompanying lung and osseous metastases. Bronchial biopsy of the lung metastasis revealed infiltration by non-small-cell adenocarcinoma of prostatic origin with neuroendocrine characteristics.

New prognostic markers are needed to better design patient-specific therapeutic regimens.\\nThe present study included 120 patients: 76 with prostate carcinoma, 12 with low-grade prostate intraepithelial lesions, 12 with high-grade prostate intraepithelial lesions, and 20 with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Immunohistochemical study was performed for Golgi phosphoprotein-3 (GOLPH3) and Y-box-binding protein-1 (YB-1) analysis. The correlation with clinicopathologic data and overall survival was analyzed.\\nBoth GOLPH3 and YB-1 showed increased expression from benign to malignant tumors. In prostate carcinoma, cytoplasmic GOLPH3 was associated with Gleason score, tumor stage, and androgen receptor status (P = .034, P < .001, and P = .008, respectively). Nuclear YB-1 expression was associated with Gleason score and androgen receptor status (P = .018 and P = .024, respectively). Cytoplasmic YB-1 expression was associated with Gleason score, tumor stage, and androgen receptor status (P = .008, P = .027, and P < .001, respectively). A high Gleason score (P = .004), high tumor stage (P < .001), and androgen receptor-independent cancer (P = .006) were the only detected adverse prognostic clinicopathologic factors. Moderate to intense GOLPH3 and high nuclear and cytoplasmic YB-1 expression correlated with shorter overall survival (P < .001, P = .020, and P < .001, respectively). On multivariate analysis, moderate to intense GOLPH3 expression was the only predictor of overall survival (P = .025).\\nHigh GOLPH3 and nuclear/cytoplasmic YB-1 expression correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. Both markers could be promising targets for new treatment strategies.',\n 'Historically, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was the only primary treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. After prostate cancer develops into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), there are a few life-prolonging drugs, including taxanes, such as docetaxel and cabazitaxel, as well as novel androgen receptor-targeting agents, such as abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide, which have been proved in clinical trials. However, the prognosis of men with CRPC is still poor. The duration from initiation of ADT to CRPC has not improved in recent decades because no novel therapeutic options have emerged. However, recently, up-front docetaxel chemotherapy has been shown to prolong progression-free as well as overall survival in men with metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer. This offers a new way to expand the role of chemotherapy for hormone-naïve prostate cancer. In this review, we summarize the proof-of-concept as well as the current status of taxane chemotherapy for hormone-naïve prostate cancer, focusing on phase 3 clinical trials investigating oncological outcome, and discuss the future direction in this field. ',\n 'The antiandrogens are medications that act by binding to intracellular androgen receptors, preventing the effects of endogenous androgens on target tissues such as testes, hair follicles, hypothalamus, pituitary, ovaries and prostate gland. The antiandrogens are used for a variety of hyperandrogenic states such as acne, hirsutism, and paraphilias, but their major use is in therapy of prostate cancer. Chemically, antiandrogens are classified into steroidal (such as cyproterone acetate) and nonsteroidal (including flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide). Cyproterone, despite evaluation in many clinical trials, has yet to receive FDA approval for use the United States, largely because of its potential for hepatotoxicity. In contrast, flutamide, nilutamide and bicalutamide are now approved and in general clinical use for therapy of prostate cancer. The largest and longest clinical experience has been with flutamide which has been shown to produce clinical remission in patients with prostate cancer, and is also used in hyperandrogenic states including acne and hirsutism. Nilutamide has been extensively studied and is indicated for use in combination with surgical castration for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer and is recommended to be started at the time of orchiectomy. Unlike flutamide, nilutamide has not been evaluated in detail as therapy of hirsutism or acne. Bicalutamide, the most recent antiandrogen to be approved for use in the United States, is also used in therapy of prostate cancer, but has not been approved for use in nonmalignant hyperandrogenic states. All three nonsteroidal antiandrogens have been linked to instances of liver injury. Minor asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels occur in 10% to 62% of patients on long term antiandrogen therapy, and prominent elevations (3 to 5 times the ULN) in 1% to 10%, the rates being somewhat higher for flutamide than nilutamide or bicalutamide. Instances of acute hepatitis with jaundice and even acute liver failure have been reported with all three antiandrogens. While most reports have related to flutamide, this may be due to its more extensive use. The rate of clinically apparent acute liver injury during prolonged antiandrogen therapy is reported to be as high as 9%, but is probably in the range of 0.1% to 1%. Screening for serum aminotransferase levels during the first few months of therapy is often recommended, but the effectiveness of this approach in preventing serious liver injury and death has not been shown. Abiraterone is a more recently developed antiandrogen used to treat prostate cancer. Abiraterone is a steroid inhibitor of CYP17, an enzyme in the pathway of androgen production which has been shown to be effective in prolonging relapse free and overall survival in men with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Abiraterone has been linked to a moderate rate of serum aminotransferasae elevations during therapy, but the abnormalities are usually mild and transient, and instances of clinically apparent liver injury have not been linked to use of this agent, although its general use has been limited.',\n 'Human MENA(11a) (hMENA(11a)), an epithelial-associated isoform of the actin binding protein enabled homolog (ENAH, also known as mammalian ENA [MENA]), is upregulated and phosphorylated following the activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) 1, HER2, and HER3. Here, we reveal a novel role of this isoform in sustaining cell survival and propose hMENA(11a) as a marker of HER3 activation and resistance to phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibition therapies. ',\n 'A point mutation in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the α isoform of class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, induces extensive remodeling of the transcriptome and proteome, resulting in a gene signature that specifically resembles that of the basal subtype, but not other types, of breast cancer. ',\n 'PREX1 is a Rac guanine exchange factor that coordinates signaling inputs from G protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). PREX1 creates a positive feedback loop to drive RTK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and MEK/ERK signaling. High PREX1 levels predict sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors in breast cancer cells. ',\n 'Pulmonary adenocarcinoma (PA) with a micropapillary component (PA-MPC) is known as an aggressive subtype of PA. The molecular profiles of PA-MPC have not been well characterized. the pathological reports of patients who underwent surgical resection for lung cancer between April, 2004 and May, 2012 were reviewed. Of the 674 patients diagnosed with PA, 28 were found to have MPC. A total of 138 resected PAs without MPC were selected in the same period to serve as age-, gender- and smoking status-matched controls to the PA-MPC group. Mutational status was determined by the following two methods: SNaPshot assay based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), primer extension and capillary electrophoresis that was designed to assess 38 somatic mutations in 8 genes [',\n 'Recent advances in tumor genetics and drug development have led to the generation of a wealth of anti-cancer-targeted therapies. These drugs aim at targeting a particular vulnerability in the tumor generated in most cases as a result of dependence on an oncogene and/or loss of a tumor suppressor. Genes in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway are the most frequently altered in human cancers. Aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Several drugs targeting PI3K/ATK have been developed and are currently in clinical trials in different phases of clinical development, alone or in combination. The impact of mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in HER2-amplified breast cancers will be the focus of this review.',\n 'Oncogenic mutations in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) are the most frequently reported in association with various forms of cancer. Several studies have reported the significance of hotspot mutations in a catalytic subunit of PIK3CA in association with breast cancer. Mutations are frequently observed in the highly conserved region of the kinase domain (797-1068 amino acids) of PIK3CA are activating or gain-of-function mutations. Mutation in codon 1047 occurs in the C-terminal region of the kinase domain with histidine (H) replaced by arginine (R), lysine (L), and tyrosine (Y). Pathogenicity and protein stability predictors PhD-SNP, Align GVGD, HANSA, iStable, and MUpro classified H1047R as highly deleterious when compared to H1047L and H1047Y. To explore the inhibitory activity of Wortmannin toward PIK3CA, the three-dimensional structure of the mutant protein was determined using homology modeling followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis. Docking studies were performed for the three mutants and native with Wortmannin to measure the differences in their binding pattern. Comparative docking study revealed that H1047R-Wortmannin complex has a higher number of hydrogen bonds as well as the best binding affinity next to the native protein. Furthermore, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was initiated with the docked complexes to understand the various changes induced by the mutation. Though Wortmannin was found to nullify the effect of H1047R over the protein, further studies are required for designing a better compound. As SNPs are major genetic variations observed in disease condition, personalized medicine would provide enhanced drug therapy.',\n 'Tamoxifen (TAM) and fulvestrant (FUL) represent the major adjuvant therapy to estrogen receptor-alpha positive (ER(+)) breast cancer patients. However, endocrine resistance to TAM and FUL is a great impediment for successful treatment. We hypothesized that miR-21 might alter the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to TAM or FUL by regulating cell autophagy. Using the ER(+) breast cancer cells, we knockdown miR-21.by transfection with miR-21 inhibitor, then the cells were exposed to TAM or FUL and the percentages of apoptosis and autophagy were determined. Knockdown of miR-21 significantly increased the TAM or FUL-induced apoptosis in ER(+) breast cancer cells. Further, silencing of miR-21 in MCF-7 cells enhanced cell autophagy at both basal and TAM or FUL-induced level. The increase of autophagy in miR-21-knockdown MCF-7 cells was also indicated by increase of beclin-1, LC3-II and increased GFP-LC3 dots. Importantly, knockdown of miR-21 contributed to autophagic cell death, which is responsible for part of TAM induced cell death in miR-21 inhibitor-transfected cells. Further analysis suggested that miR-21 inhibitor enhance autophagic cell death through inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. MiR-21 coordinated the function of autophagy and apoptosis by targeting Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) through inhibition of PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. In conclusion, silencing of miR-21 increased the sensitivity of ER(+) breast cancer cells to TAM or FUL by increasing autophagic cell death. Targeting autophagy-related miRNAs is a potential strategy for overcoming endocrine resistance to TAM and FUL. ',\n 'Activation of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is common in breast cancer. There is preclinical data to support inhibition of the pathway, and phase I to III trials involving inhibitors of the pathway have been or are being conducted in solid tumors and breast cancer. Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, is currently approved for the treatment of hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer. In this review, we summarise the efficacy and toxicity findings from the randomised clinical trials, with simplified guidelines on the management of potential adverse effects. Education of healthcare professionals and patients is critical for safety and compliance. While there is some clinical evidence of activity of mTOR inhibition in HR-positive and HER2-positive breast cancers, the benefits may be more pronounced in selected subsets rather than in the overall population. Further development of predictive biomarkers will be useful in the selection of patients who will benefit from inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (PAM) pathway. ',\n 'Accurate diagnosis of salivary duct carcinoma requires a high index of suspicion and clinicopathologic correlation. Hallmark genetic changes that may provide novel therapeutic options are being explored.\\nOne hundred ninety salivary gland malignancies at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (from 1989-2014) were reviewed. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and androgen receptor status were determined along with multigene profiling.\\nTwenty-three salivary duct carcinomas were identified, predominantly in men in their fifth to ninth decades of life. Facial nerve palsy (12%) and cervical lymph node metastases (82%) were present, and 96% received postoperative adjuvant therapy. Histologically, the tumors resembled high-grade invasive and in situ ductal carcinoma of the breast. Micropapillary, papillary, sarcomatoid, oncocytic, and mucinous variants were seen. The tumors showed androgen receptor (70%), HER2 amplification (30%), and HRAS, AKT1, PIK3CA, and NRAS mutations (22%; cumulative). The 5-year disease-free survival was 36%.\\nSalivary duct carcinoma demonstrates a wide histopathologic spectrum. Treatment strategies need to take androgen receptor, HER2 amplification, and PIK3CA mutation into account. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck 38: E1838-E1847, 2016.',\n 'The forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are considered as tumor suppressors that limit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. FOXO gene alterations have been described in a limited number of human cancers, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, leukemia and lymphoma. In addition, FOXO proteins are inactivated by major oncogenic signals such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway and MAP kinases. Their expression is also repressed by micro-RNAs in multiple cancer types. FOXOs are mediators of the tumor response to various therapies. However, paradoxical roles of FOXOs in cancer progression were recently described. FOXOs contribute to the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells in acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. These factors may also promote invasion and metastasis of subsets of colon and breast cancers. Resistance to treatment was also ascribed to FOXO activation in multiple cases, including targeted therapies. In this review, we discuss the complex role of FOXOs in cancer development and response to therapy. ',\n 'Adding a PI3K inhibitor to anti-estrogen receptor therapy may be a viable treatment option for women with advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer that becomes resistant to endocrine therapy, according to findings from the phase III BELLE-2 trial, presented at the 2015 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. ',\n 'Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) are a more aggressive subset of breast cancer. A better understanding of its biology could allow the rational development of targeted therapies.\\nWe extensively analyzed the EGFR/PI3K/PTEN axis in a large, homogeneous population of TNBC to help defining the putative role of anti-EGFR and -PI3K targeted therapies in this setting. EGFR gene amplification, EGFR protein expression, PIK3CA and PTEN gene alterations (two members of EGFR downstream pathways) and their clinicopathological and prognostic implications were analyzed in 204 TNBC samples from European patients.\\nEGFR amplification was detected in 18 of the 204 TNBC specimens (8.9 %) and was significantly associated with higher EGFR protein levels. Fourteen PIK3CA mutations were identified in exon 9 (6.7 %), and 17 in exon 20 (8.3 %). PIK3CA mutations, especially in exon 9, were significantly associated with grade I-II tumors. PTEN deletions were detected in 43 samples (21.50 %) and were significantly associated with grade III tumors (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Univariate analysis showed a significant association between relapse-free survival (RFS), T and N stage and exon 9 PIK3CA mutations. Overall survival was significantly associated with T stage, N stage and adjuvant chemotherapy, which was administered to 70.3 % of patients. In multivariate analyses, T stage, N stage, presence of exon 9 PIK3CA mutations and high EGFR protein level were independent poor prognostic factors for RFS, while adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a better outcome.\\nHigh EGFR protein expression and exon 9 PIK3CA activating mutations are independent prognostic factors in TNBC. The efficacy of anti-PI3K targeted therapies needs to be evaluated in this setting.',\n 'We have previously shown that dysregulation of miR-21 functioned as an oncomiR in breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms by which miR-21 regulate breast tumor migration and invasion. We applied pathway analysis on genome microarray data and target-predicting algorithms for miR-21 target screening, and used luciferase reporting assay to confirm the direct target. Thereafter, we investigated the function of the target gene phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 1 (α) (PIK3R1), and detected PIK3R1 coding protein (p85α) by immunohistochemistry and miR-21 by RT-qPCR on 320 archival paraffin-embedded tissues of breast cancer to evaluate the correlation of their expression with prognosis. First, we found that PIK3R1 suppressed growth, invasiveness, and metastatic properties of breast cancer cells. Next, we identified the PIK3R1 as a direct target of miR-21 and showed that it was negatively regulated by miR-21. Furthermore, we demonstrated that p85α overexpression phenocopied the suppression effects of antimiR-21 on breast cancer cell growth, migration and invasion, indicating its tumor suppressor role in breast cancer. On the contrary, PIK3R1 knockdown abrogated antimiR‑21-induced effect on breast cancer cells. Notably, antimiR-21 induction increased p85α, accompanied by decreased p-AKT level. Besides, antimiR-21/PIK3R1-induced suppression of invasiveness in breast cancer cells was mediated by reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). p85α downregulation was found in 25 (7.8%) of the 320 breast cancer patients, and was associated with inferior 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Taken together, we provide novel evidence that miR-21 knockdown suppresses cell growth, migration and invasion partly by inhibiting PI3K/AKT activation via direct targeting PIK3R1 and reversing EMT in breast cancer. p85α downregulation defined a specific subgroup of breast cancer with shorter 5-year DFS and OS, which may require more aggressive treatment.',\n 'Despite advances in cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies, 5-year survival rates remain low for patients with advanced breast cancer at diagnosis. This highlights the limited effectiveness of current treatment options. An improved understanding of cellular functions associated with the development and progression of breast cancer has resulted in the creation of a number of novel targeted molecular therapies. However, more work is needed to improve outcomes, particularly in the first-line recurrent or metastatic hormone receptor-positive breast cancer setting. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a major intracellular signaling pathway that is often upregulated in breast cancer, and overactivation of this pathway has been associated with primary or developed resistance to endocrine treatment. Clinical data from the Phase III Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus-2 (BOLERO-2) study of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus combined with exemestane in hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer were very promising, highlighting the potential role of mTOR inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapies as a first-line treatment option for these patients. It is hoped that the use of mTOR inhibitors combined with current standard-of-care endocrine therapies, such as aromatase inhibitors, in the first-line advanced breast cancer setting may result in greater antitumor effects and also delay or reverse treatment resistance. ',\n 'Flavones found in plants display various biological activities, including anti-allergic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidation, and anti-tumor effects. In this study, we investigated the anti-tumor effects of flavone, apigenin and luteolin on human breast cancer cells.\\nThe anti-cancer activity of flavone, apigenin and luteolin was investigated using the MTS assay. Apoptosis was analyzed by Hoechst 33342 staining, flow cytometry and western blot. Cell migration was determined using the culture inserts and xCELLigence real-time cell analyzer instrument equipped with a CIM-plate 16. Real-time quantitative PCR and western blot were used to determine the signaling pathway elicited by flavone, apigenin and luteolin.\\nFlavone, apigenin and luteolin showed potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation of Hs578T, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. The ability of flavone, apigenin and luteolin to inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells through apoptosis was confirmed by Hoechst33342 staining and the induction of sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle. Flavone, apigenin and luteolin induced forkhead box O3 (FOXO3a) expression by inhibiting Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. This subsequently elevated the expression of FOXO3a target genes, including the Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21Cip1 (p21) and p27kip1 (p27), which increased the levels of activated poly(ADP) polymerase (PARP) and cytochrome c.\\nTaken together, these data demonstrated that flavone, apigenin and luteolin induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells through inhibiting PI3K/Akt activation and increasing FOXO3a activation, which suggest that flavone, apigenin and luteolin will be the potential leads for the preventing and treating of breast cancer.',\n 'The multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype often accompanies activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which renders a survival signal to withstand cytotoxic anticancer drugs and enhances cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics. As a result, PI3K/AKT-blocking approaches have been proposed as antineoplastic strategies, and inhibitors of PI3K/AKT are currently being trailed clinically in breast cancer patients. However, the effects of PI3K inhibitors on MDR breast cancers have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, the tumorigenic properties of three MDR breast cancer cell lines to a selective inhibitor of PI3K, NVP-BKM120 (BKM120), were assessed. We found that BKM120 showed a significant cytotoxic activity on MDR breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. When doxorubicin (DOX) was combined with BKM120, strong synergistic antiproliferative effect was observed. BKM120 activity induced the blockage of PI3K/AKT signaling and NF-κB expression, which in turn led to activate caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 and changed the expression of several apoptosis-related gene expression. Furthermore, BKM120 effectively eliminated CSC subpopulation and reduced sphere formation of these drug-resistant cells. Our findings indicate that BKM120 partially overcomes the MDR phenotype in chemoresistant breast cancer through cell apoptosis induction and CSC abolishing, which appears to be mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/NF-κB axis. This offers a strong rationale to explore the therapeutic strategy of using BKM120 alone or in combination for chemotherapy-nonresponsive breast cancer patients. ',\n \"Due to the spatial and temporal genomic heterogeneity of breast cancer, genomic sequencing obtained from a single biopsy may not capture the complete genomic profile of tumors. Thus, we propose that cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma may be an alternate source of genomic information to provide comprehensive data throughout a patient's clinical course. We performed a retrospective chart review of 100 patients with stage 4 or high-risk stage 3 breast cancer. The degree of agreement between genomic alterations found in tumor DNA (tDNA) and cfDNA was determined by Cohen's Kappa. Clinical disease progression was compared to mutant allele frequency using a two-sided Fisher's exact test. The presence of mutations and mutant allele frequency was correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) using a Cox proportional hazards model and a log-rank test. The most commonly found genomic alterations were mutations in TP53 and PIK3CA, and amplification of EGFR and ERBB2. PIK3CA mutation and ERBB2 amplification demonstrated robust agreement between tDNA and cfDNA (Cohen's kappa\\xa0=\\xa00.64 and 0.77, respectively). TP53 mutation and EGFR amplification demonstrated poor agreement between tDNA and cfDNA (Cohen's kappa\\xa0=\\xa00.18 and 0.33, respectively). The directional changes of TP53 and PIK3CA mutant allele frequency were closely associated with response to therapy (p\\xa0=\\xa00.002). The presence of TP53 mutation (p\\xa0=\\xa00.0004) and PIK3CA mutant allele frequency [p\\xa0=\\xa00.01, HR 1.074 (95\\xa0% CI 1.018-1.134)] was excellent predictors of PFS. Identification of selected cancer-specific genomic alterations from cfDNA may be a noninvasive way to monitor disease progression, predict PFS, and offer targeted therapy. \",\n 'The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway is commonly deregulated in breast cancer through several mechanisms, including PI3K catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations and loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The hiperactivated PI3K/AKT signaling can be associated with endocrine or trastuzumab therapy resistance and underscore the impact of targeting the pathway. Our aim was to identify PIK3CA mutations and the mechanisms of PTEN loss and assess their therapeutic consequences in breast cancer patients. In addition, we aimed to identify further possible therapeutic targets associated with PTEN loss. Sixty-nine primary breast cancer samples (24 ER+/PR+/HER2-, 20 HER2+ (ER-/PR-/HER2+) and 25 triple-negative (TN) samples) were studied. We determined the PTEN mRNA levels, PTEN and PIK3CA mutations, PTEN allelic loss and promoter hypermethylation. mRNA expression patterns of PTEN knocked out and wild type MCF10A cell lines were compared using oligonucleotide microarray and their sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitor PD166866 was tested. Elevated PI3K/AKT pathway activity was found in 68% of TN and about 45% of ER+/PR+ and HER2+ tumors. PTEN loss was dominant in TN and HER2+ tumors, while PTEN loss and PI3K activation were equally represented in ER+/PR+ cancers. The coexistence of PTEN loss and PI3K activation was typical of a portion of HER2+ tumors. The PTEN-deficient MCF10A cell line showed increased expression of certain members of the fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)/FGFR1 pathway. We suppose that loss of PTEN enhances the autocrine FGF signaling promoting cell proliferation. FGF-2 and FGFR1 can be potential targets in PTEN deficient breast cancers. \\nVizsgálataink célja a foszfatidilinozitol-3-kináz/AKT (PI3K/AKT) növekedési jelátviteli útvonal genomikai paramétereinek összehasonlítása volt különbözõ emlõdaganat-típusokban. A PI3K/AKT jelátviteli útvonal gyakran mutat fokozott aktivitást emlõdaganatokban a PI3K-aktiváció vagy a proteinfoszfatáz és tenzin homológ (PTEN) inaktiválódása következményeként, így a szignálútban szereplõ gének aktiválása/inaktiválása meghatározó szerepet játszik a kemorezisztencia (tamoxifen, trastuzumab) kialakulásában is. Ezért célul tûztük ki a PTEN-vesztés mechanizmusainak és a PI3K katalitikus alegysége (PIK3CA) „forrópont”-mutációinak meghatározását, mivel ezek az adatok a terápiás érzékenység elõrejelzését teszik lehetõvé. Új terápiás célpontok meghatározására PTEN-deficiens MCF10A sejtvonalat használtunk. Vizsgálatainkban 69 primer emlõtumorban határoztuk meg a PTEN-mRNS-szintet, a PTEN- és PIK3CA-mutációkat, valamint a PTEN-allélvesztést és promoter-hipermetilációt. PTEN-hiányos és PTEN-t expresszáló izogenikus MCF10A emlõráksejtvonalak mRNS-expressziós mintázatát oligonukleotid microarray segítségével hasonlítottuk össze, PD166866 FGFR1-inhibitorral szembeni érzékenységüket citotoxicitási assay-vel vizsgáltuk. Eredményeink szerint a tripla-negatív (TN) daganatok mintegy 68%-ában, míg az ER+/PR+ és HER2+ tumorok 45%-ában következetett be a PI3K/AKT út fokozott aktivitása. A TN és HER2+ daganatokra a PTEN gén funkcióvesztése jellemzõ. Az ER+/PR+ daganatokban vagy a PTEN-inaktiváció, vagy a PI3K-aktiválódás figyelhetõ meg. A HER2+ daganatok egy csoportjában a PTEN-inaktiváció és a PI3K-aktiváció együttesen fordul elõ. A PTEN-hiányos MCF10A emlõráksejtvonalban fokozott expressziót mutattak a fibroblaszt növekedési faktor 2 (FGF2)/FGFR1 jelútvonal egyes tagjai. Feltételezzük, hogy a PTEN hiánya felerõsíti az autokrin FGF-szignalizációt, mely fokozza a sejtproliferációt. Az FGF2 és FGFR1 ígéretes terápiás célpont lehet a PTEN-negatív emlõdaganatokban.',\n 'Brain metastases are common and devastating complications of both breast cancer and melanoma. Although mammary carcinoma brain metastases are more frequent than those originating from melanoma, this latter has the highest tropism to the brain. Using static and dynamic in vitro approaches, here we show that melanoma cells have increased adhesion to the brain endothelium in comparison to breast cancer cells. Moreover, melanoma cells can transmigrate more rapidly and in a higher number through brain endothelial monolayers than breast cancer cells. In addition, melanoma cells have increased ability to impair tight junctions of cerebral endothelial cells. We also show that inhibition of Rac or PI3K impedes adhesion of breast cancer cells and melanoma cells to the brain endothelium. In addition, inhibition of Rac or PI3K inhibits the late phase of transmigration of breast cancer cells and the early phase of transmigration of melanoma cells. On the other hand, the Rac inhibitor EHT1864 impairs the junctional integrity of the brain endothelium, while the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has no damaging effect on interendothelial junctions. We suggest that targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway may represent a novel opportunity in preventing the formation of brain metastases of melanoma and breast cancer.',\n 'Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) has been proposed as a non-obligate precursor of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). Here we sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in pure LCIS and in synchronous LCIS and ILC using targeted massively parallel sequencing.\\nDNA samples extracted from microdissected LCIS, ILC and matched normal breast tissue or peripheral blood from 30 patients were subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 273 genes, including the genes most frequently mutated in breast cancer and DNA repair-related genes. Single nucleotide variants and insertions and deletions were identified using state-of-the-art bioinformatics approaches.\\nThe constellation of somatic mutations found in LCIS (n = 34) and ILC (n = 21) were similar, with the most frequently mutated genes being CDH1 (56% and 66%, respectively), PIK3CA (41% and 52%, respectively) and CBFB (12% and 19%, respectively). Among 19 LCIS and ILC synchronous pairs, 14 (74%) had at least one identical mutation in common, including identical PIK3CA and CDH1 mutations. Paired analysis of independent foci of LCIS from 3 breasts revealed at least one common mutation in each of the 3 pairs (CDH1, PIK3CA, CBFB and PKHD1L1).\\nLCIS and ILC have a similar repertoire of somatic mutations, with PIK3CA and CDH1 being the most frequently mutated genes. The presence of identical mutations between LCIS-LCIS and LCIS-ILC pairs demonstrates that LCIS is a clonal neoplastic lesion, and provides additional evidence that at least some LCIS are non-obligate precursors of ILC.',\n 'Bone flare reaction as a sign of response to antineoplastic treatment has been redefined, including the onset of new osteoblastic lesions. If misunderstood as skeletal progression, this finding could lead to erroneous therapy discontinuation, changing the disease clinical course. We aim to describe this clinical phenomenon in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene-activating mutations treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).\\nWe retrospectively reviewed the computed tomography scans of 43 EGFR-mutated patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKI, analyzing the bone response in terms of increase in the quantity and/or density of lesions, and assessing objective tumor response to treatment.\\nOsteoblastic reaction was detected in 10 cases (23%), showing different patterns: dimensional or density increase of known osteosclerotic metastases (pattern A, n = 4); response of previously lytic lesions (pattern B, n = 2); onset of new osteosclerotic lesions (pattern C, n = 4). Seven patients had partial response to TKI treatment, with response rate of 70%, vs 50% of patients with bone metastases without this reaction. No difference in terms of median overall survival or progression-free survival emerged between patients with or without osteoblastic reaction.\\nThe correct clinico-radiologic interpretation of osteoblastic reaction is crucial to avoid waste of therapeutic lines when TKI treatment has not yet exhausted its potential effectiveness. Clinical implications of ambiguous radiologic findings as described in this study deserve further discussion.',\n 'Mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in approximately 10% of lung cancers. Treatment with EGFR inhibitors, although promising, has surprisingly resulted in greater than 90% tumor reduction in only 5% of cases, prompting us to investigate the mechanism of innate drug resistance. ',\n 'We have performed a study using cell lines established from biopsies of clinically resistant non-small cell lung cancers with the aim of discovering therapeutic strategies to overcome acquired resistance. Our results indicate that pharmacological assessment of tumor material might efficiently complement genetic profiling in the future path toward personalized medicine. ',\n 'The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between intron 1 CA-repeat polymorphisms of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) and the clinical outcome of Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We genotyped the intron 1 CA-repeat genetic polymorphisms of EGFR in 84 Chinese patients with NSCLC. The relationship between the length of the CA repeats and EGFR mutations in exons 18-21 in the 84 patients was elucidated. We then analyzed the association between the length of the CA repeats and the clinical outcome of EGFR-TKI-treated patients with NSCLC. EGFR mutations in exon 19 were significantly associated with shorter CA repeats. Patients with shorter CA repeats had a significantly longer progression-free survival with EGFR-TKI treatment than those with longer CA repeats. Our results suggest that shorter CA repeats in intron 1 of EGFR are associated with EGFR mutations and the clinical outcomes of TKI-treated patients with NSCLC. ',\n 'There is only limited data on the prevalence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations in squamous cell carcinomas and adenosquamous carcinomas of the lung in patients of the Southern Bulgarian region and the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\\nPrevious reports for Bulgarian population showed high incidence of EGFR mutations in the squamous cell carcinomas, so we set the goal to investigate their frequency in Southern Bulgaria, after precise immunohistochemical verification of lung cancers.\\nTwo hundred and thirty-six lung carcinomas were included in this prospective study. All biopsies were initially analysed with p63, TTF1, Napsin A, CK7, CK34βE12, synaptophysin, CK20 and CDX2. Two hundred and twenty-five non-small cell lung carcinomas were studied with real-time PCR technology to assess the status of the EGFR gene.\\nWe detected 132 adenocarcinomas (58.7%), 89 squamous cell carcinomas (39.2%), 4 adenosquamous carcinomas (1.8%), 9 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (3.8%) and 2 metastatic colorectal adenocarcinomas (0.8%). Activating mutations in the EGF receptor had 3 out of 89 squamous cell carcinomas (3.37%). We have established mutations in L858R, deletion in exon 19 and rare mutation in S7681. One out of four adenosquamous carcinomas had a point mutation in the L858R (25%).\\nThe frequency of EGFR mutations we found in lung squamous cell carcinomas in a Southern Bulgarian region is lower than that in European countries. Ethnic diversity in the region does not play role of an independent predictive factor in terms of mutation frequency.',\n 'Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related malignancy responsible for death. Mutational status is crucial for choosing treatment of advanced NSCLC, yet no data is available on the frequency of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten ras (KRAS) mutations and their impact on NSCLC in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients (HIV-NSCLC). All consecutive HIV-NSCLC patients diagnosed between June 1996 and August 2013 at two Paris university hospitals were reviewed, with tumor samples analyzed for EGFR and KRAS mutational status. Overall, 63 tumor samples were analyzed out of 73 HIV-NSCLC cases, with 63% of advanced NSCLC. There were 60 non-squamous and nine squamous cell carcinomas, with EGFR and KRAS mutations identified in two (3.3%) and seven (11.5%) tumors, respectively. The proportion of KRAS mutations was 29% if solely the more sensitive molecular techniques were considered. The two patients with advanced adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations exhibited lasting partial response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Overall survival for patients with advanced NSCLC were >30 months for those with EGFR mutations, <3 months for KRAS mutations (n=2), and the median was 9 months [4.1-14.3] for wild-type (n=34). In multivariate analysis, KRAS mutation and CD4<200 cells/μL were associated with poor prognosis (hazard ratio (HR): 24 [4.1-140.2], p=0.0004; HR: 3.1 [1.3-7.5], p=0.01, respectively). EGFR mutation must be investigated in HIV-NSCLC cases due to its predictive and prognostic impact, whereas KRAS mutation is of poor prognostic value. Clinicians should search for drugs dedicated to this target population.',\n 'Local ablative therapy with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may improve survival in oncogene-addicted lung cancer patients with extracranial oligometastatic disease treated with targeted therapies. There is limited data on the use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in this same setting.

',\n None,\n 'The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a marker of poor prognosis in lung cancer patients. However, previous data have been based on an heterogeneous population of lung cancer patients and various treatments. In this study, we evaluate the prognostic value of NLR in an homogeneous population of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.\\nWe restrospectively evaluated the data of 250 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations. All data are based on first-line treatment.\\nAll tumors harbored in-frame deletions in exon 19 or an L858R point mutation. Eighty-five patients were treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), while 165 received cytotoxic chemotherapy as first-line treatment. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that the NLR was a significant prognostic factor for first-line progression-free survival (PFS) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.882, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.319-2.686, P = 0.001), but was not significant in the TKI group (HR 1.239, 95% CI 0.693-2.215, P = 0.469). The response rate (RR) to first-line treatment was 76.5% in the TKI group and 29.5% in the chemotherapy group; however, the RR, according to the NLR (≤3 vs. > 3), was the same for both groups.\\nThe NLR was a significant prognostic factor in the chemotherapy group, but it did not affect either RR or PFS in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with TKIs.',\n 'Gefitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor used in the therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.

The assessment was conducted in comparison with the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT). In principle, the company concurred with the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA)’s specification. In research question 1 (non-pretreated patients), it chose the second option offered by the G-BA (differentiation of the ACT according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status [ECOG PS]). The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. One comparative randomized controlled trial (RCT) was included in the assessment.',\n 'Currently, blockade of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) signaling pathway has been proved one of the most promising immunotherapeutic strategies against cancer. Several antibodies have been developed to either block the PD-1 or its ligand PD-L1 are under development. So far, a series of phase I trials on PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been completed, without reports of results from phase II studies. Thus, we sought to perform a meta-analysis incorporating all available evidences to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibition therapy.\\nElectronic databases were searched for eligible literatures. Data of objective respond rate (ORR) and rate of adverse effects (AEs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was extracted. The outcomes were synthesized based on random-effect model. Subgroup analyses were proposed.\\nIn overall, ORR in the whole population with PD-1 blockage treatment is 22.5% (95% CI: 17.6% to 28.2%). Additionally, the rate of Grade 3-4 AEs is 16.7% (95% CI: 6.5% to 36.8%) and drug-related death rate is 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3% to 4.6%). As for patients with PD-L1 inhibition therapy, an overall ORR is 19.5% (95% CI: 13.2% to 27.7%). A higher rate of Grade 3-4 AEs (31.7%, 95% CI: 14.2% to 56.5%) is observed with a lower drug-related death rate (1.8%, 95% CI: 0.4% to 8.3%). In exploratory analyses of anti-PD-1 agents, we observed that greater ORR was presented in the median-dose cohort (3 mg/kg) than that of both low-dose (1 mg/kg) and high-dose (10 mg/kg) cohort (low-dose vs. median-dose: OR =0.12, P=0.0002; median-dose vs. high-dose: OR =1.47, P=0.18).\\nAnti-PD-1 and anti PD-L1 antibodies showed objective responses in approximately one fourth NSCLC patients with a tolerable adverse-effect profile. In addition, median-dose (3 mg/kg) might be a preferential dosage of anti-PD-1 agents.',\n \"Some tumors evade immune responses by exploiting immune checkpoint pathways and other regulatory mechanisms. Recent advances in the understanding of immune evasion strategies has given rise to development of novel immunotherapies that can restore the patient's own immune system to respond to and eliminate cancer cells.\\nMultiple agents targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) pathway, both anti-PD-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 (a key ligand for PD-1) compounds, are currently in active clinical development for lung cancer. Preliminary data of efficacy as monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy are promising. In this review, we will summarize the immunomodulatory environment in NSCLC, we will focus on immune-checkpoint inhibitors, and the data currently available in lung cancer.\\nThe immune-mediated therapies represent an exciting new therapeutic approach, but evidences are still early in lung cancer, and more data from clinical studies are needed to optimize the clinical impact of these therapies.\",\n \"Cancer cells employ several mechanisms to evade the immune system of their host, thus escaping immune recognition and elimination. Of particular interest is a cancer cell's ability to co-opt the immune system's innate ligands and inhibitory receptors (also known as checkpoints), thus creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment that downregulates T-cell activation and cell signaling. The recent development of the checkpoint inhibitors anti-programmed death-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 has generated an enormous amount of interest as a potential new anticancer strategy in solid tumors, particularly in non-small-cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. Data suggest significant disease response rates using anti-programmed death-1 and anti-programmed death ligand-1 antibodies, even in heavily pretreated patients. Future directions include optimization of drug delivery sequence and combination of immunotherapy with other therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, antiangiogenic agents and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. \",\n 'Because of dramatic tumor regressions reported with the anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PDL-1) antibodies inhibiting the PD-1 immune checkpoint, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is now recognized as an immune-modifiable disease. As responses were observed in smaller numbers in phase I trials, the immunologic profiles and unique toxicities of these agents have not been fully established in NSCLC. Moreover, PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors in development by different companies may demonstrate diverse spectrums of activity and toxicity. Although the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) checkpoint inhibitors in earlier phase studies appeared to have less impressive responses in NSCLC, their safety profile has been more broadly defined. The anti-CTLA-4 antibody, ipilimumab, has the best characterized immune-related toxicities (predominantly skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine) and management strategies in melanoma. Despite the lack of studies directly comparing these agents, toxicities from PD-1 inhibition seem milder than those of CTLA-4 inhibition, with distinct toxicities of pneumonitis infrequently observed with the BMS-936558 anti-PD-1 antibody, nivolumamb, and frequent mild infusion reactions reported with the BMS-936559 anti-PDL-1 antibody. As lungs are critical organs often already compromised in NSCLC patients, immune-mediated pneumonitis can cause worrisome morbidity and mortality. Even though immune checkpoint inhibitors are being rapidly developed in a multitude of trials, optimal immune-mediated toxicity management has not been determined, is evolving, and will be further explored. Early diagnosis and symptom management with corticosteroids form the basis of treatment. Assessment of new immune-response criteria and use of primary endpoints of overall survival (OS) will be important in the development of these immunotherapies in NSCLC. ',\n 'Multiple agents targeting the immune \"checkpoint\" programmed death-1 (PD-1) pathway have demonstrated early evidence of durable clinical activity and an encouraging safety profile in patients with various tumor types, including some cancers, such as non-small-cell lung cancer, historically perceived as non-immunogenic and thus nonresponsive to immunotherapy.\\nFunctions of the PD-1 pathway in normal immune responses are reviewed, along with the significance of expression of PD-1 and its ligands in malignant settings. Rationale for the development of PD-1 pathway-targeted therapies and associated clinical data are presented. Finally, efforts to date to identify and develop partner predictive or prognostic biomarkers for these new PD-1 pathway-targeted immunotherapies are discussed.\\nRather than targeting the tumor directly, immunotherapies inhibiting PD-1 pathway signaling modulate the antitumor immune response. Indeed, these agents have already demonstrated promising antitumor activity and manageable toxicity in various cancers. If future data continue to support encouraging clinical profiles of anti-PD-1 and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibodies, the current paradigm of cancer therapy may shift. In select patient populations (ideally identified by a predictive biomarker), PD-1 pathway-targeted immunotherapy has the potential to serve as the backbone of cancer treatment, and trials evaluating combinations with chemotherapy and/or molecularly targeted therapies will determine whether additive or even synergistic responses can be achieved.',\n 'Immunologic checkpoint blockade with antibodies against the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) is an effective method for reversing cancer immunosuppression and thereby promoting immune responses against several cancer types. Anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies have resulted in long-term responses with minimal side effects in significant numbers of patients with melanoma, lung, kidney, bladder and triple-negative breast cancer, as well as in chemotherapy-refractory Hodgkin disease. There is already evidence from at least one randomised trial that anti-PD-1 therapy is superior to chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, and two anti-PD-1 antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients previously treated for metastatic melanoma. It is anticipated that approvals by drug regulatory bodies will be forthcoming in several cancers in the next months. ',\n 'To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of the diffuse-type giant cell tumours, also called pigmented villonodular synovitis, a rare, aggressive condition of the synovium, the knee synovial tissue expression of colony-stimulating factor-1 gene, as detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction, was compared between patients affected with pigmented villonodular knee synovitis and knee meniscal tears, or persistent gonoarthitis.\\nMultiple synovial biopsies of the knee were performed by arthroscopy in five consecutive patients affected by diffuse pigmented villonodular knee synovitis and in 12 patients affected by knee meniscal tears (n. 6) or persistent active gonarthritis (n. 6), recruited from the patients attending the Rheumatology Day Surgery Outpatient Clinic of the University of Padova Hospital. The ethics committee approved the study protocol and the participants signed consent statements after being informed about the content of the study. The diagnosis was made on the basis of a histological examination. The colony-stimulating factor-1 gene expression was assessed by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.\\nThe detection by RT-PCR of synovial colony-stimulating factor-1 mRNA showed a wide spectrum of expression in the three groups of distinct knee joint disease affected patients, with significantly higher level of colony-stimulating factor-1 mRNA expression in synovial tissue of pigmented villonodular synovitis, in comparison to that of knee meniscal injuries and persistent gonoarthritis patients.\\nOur findings point out to an important role of colony-stimulating factor-1 in pigmented villonodular knee synovitis disease process and support the idea that colony-stimulating factor-1/colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor interaction may represent a potential therapeutic target of this disease.',\n 'Clinical targeting of multi-dimensional proteins such as the proteasome has been efficacious in recent years. Inhibitors such as bortezomib and carfilzomib have been used successfully to treat multiple myeloma despite early skepticism surrounding unsubstantiated toxic side effects. Another target of this magnitude is ready to emerge as a clinically viable option for targeting various neoplasias. This target, XPO1 (exportin-1 also known as Chromosome Region Maintenance 1 (CRM1)), is the transport protein responsible for nuclear export of many of the major tumor suppressor proteins and cell growth regulators. Up-regulation of XPO1 protein, a common occurrence in a variety of cancers, can lead to aberrant cytoplasmic localization and degradation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and FOXO. Therefore, inhibition of XPO1 using specific small molecules collectively called Selective Inhibitors of Nuclear Export (SINE) could potentially restore normal tumor suppressor function and have universal application for the treatment of cancer. This review will discuss the current pre-clinical data on SINE compounds in both hematological and solid malignancies. Cancer treatment through direct inhibition of the proteasome and the nuclear export machinery should instill optimism for further targeting of critical cellular pathways. ',\n 'Nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of proteins is a significant factor in the development of cancer and drug resistance. Subcellular localization of exported proteins linked to cancer development include those involved in cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, transformation, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, invasion, and metastasis. Here, we examined the basic mechanisms involved in the export of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. All proteins over 40kDa use the nuclear pore complex to gain entry or exit from the nucleus, with the primary nuclear export molecule involved in these processes being chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1, exportin 1 or XPO1). Proteins exported from the nucleus must possess a hydrophobic nuclear export signal (NES) peptide that binds to a hydrophobic groove containing an active-site Cys528 in the CRM1 protein. CRM1 inhibitors function largely by covalent modification of the active site Cys528 and prevent binding to the cargo protein NES. In the absence of a CRM1 inhibitor, CRM1 binds cooperatively to the NES of the cargo protein and RanGTP, forming a trimer that is actively transported out of the nucleus by facilitated diffusion. Nuclear export can be blocked by CRM1 inhibitors, NES peptide inhibitors or by preventing post-translational modification of cargo proteins. Clinical trials using the classic CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B proved too toxic for patients; however, a new generation of less toxic small molecule inhibitors is being used in clinical trials in patients with both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Additional trials are being initiated using small-molecule CRM1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutics such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. In this review, we present evidence that combining the new CRM1 inhibitors with other classes of therapeutics may prove effective in the treatment of cancer. Potential combinatorial therapies discussed include the use of CRM1 inhibitors and the addition of alkylating agents (melphalan), anthracyclines (doxorubicin and daunomycin), BRAF inhibitors, platinum drugs (cisplatin and oxaliplatin), proteosome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib), or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib). Also, the sequence of treatment may be important for combination therapy. We found that the most effective treatment regimen involved first priming the cancer cells with the CRM1 inhibitor followed by doxorubicin, bortezomib, carfilzomib, or melphalan. This order sensitized both de novo and acquired drug-resistant cancer cell lines. ',\n 'RNA interference screening identified XPO1 (exportin 1) among the 55 most vulnerable targets in multiple myeloma (MM). XPO1 encodes CRM1, a nuclear export protein. XPO1 expression increases with MM disease progression. Patients with MM have a higher expression of XPO1 compared with normal plasma cells (P<0.04) and to patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance/smoldering MM (P<0.0001). The highest XPO1 level was found in human MM cell lines (HMCLs). A selective inhibitor of nuclear export compound KPT-276 specifically and irreversibly inhibits the nuclear export function of XPO1. The viability of 12 HMCLs treated with KTP-276 was significantly reduced. KPT-276 also actively induced apoptosis in primary MM patient samples. In gene expression analyses, two genes of probable relevance were dysregulated by KPT-276: cell division cycle 25 homolog A (CDC25A) and bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), both of which are associated with c-MYC pathway. Western blotting and reverse transcription-PCR confirm that c-MYC, CDC25A and BRD4 are all downregulated after treatment with KPT-276. KPT-276 reduced monoclonal spikes in the Vk*MYC transgenic MM mouse model, and inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft MM mouse model. A phase I clinical trial of an analog of KPT-276 is ongoing in hematological malignancies including MM. ',\n 'The key nuclear export protein CRM1/XPO1 may represent a promising novel therapeutic target in human multiple myeloma (MM). Here we showed that chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) is highly expressed in patients with MM, plasma cell leukemia cells and increased in patient cells resistant to bortezomib treatment. CRM1 expression also correlates with increased lytic bone and shorter survival. Importantly, CRM1 knockdown inhibits MM cell viability. Novel, oral, irreversible selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) targeting CRM1 (KPT-185, KPT-330) induce cytotoxicity against MM cells (ED50<200\\u2009nM), alone and cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) or osteoclasts (OC). SINEs trigger nuclear accumulation of multiple CRM1 cargo tumor suppressor proteins followed by growth arrest and apoptosis in MM cells. They further block c-myc, Mcl-1, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity. SINEs induce proteasome-dependent CRM1 protein degradation; concurrently, they upregulate CRM1, p53-targeted, apoptosis-related, anti-inflammatory and stress-related gene transcripts in MM cells. In SCID mice with diffuse human MM bone lesions, SINEs show strong anti-MM activity, inhibit MM-induced bone lysis and prolong survival. Moreover, SINEs directly impair osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption via blockade of RANKL-induced NF-κB and NFATc1, with minimal impact on osteoblasts and BMSCs. These results support clinical development of SINE CRM1 antagonists to improve patient outcome in MM. ',\n 'CRM1 plays an important role in the nuclear export of cargo proteins bearing nuclear exporting signal sequences. Leptomycin B (LMB), a well-known CRM1 inhibitor, possesses strong antitumor properties. However, its toxicity prevents it from being clinically useful. In this study, we demonstrate that a novel compound, CBS9106, inhibits CRM1-dependent nuclear export, causing arrest of the cell cycle and inducing apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner for a broad spectrum of cancer cells, including multiple myeloma cells. CBS9106 reduces CRM1 protein levels significantly without affecting CRM1 mRNA expression. This effect could be reversed by adding bortezomib or LMB. Moreover, CBS9106-biotin allows capture of CRM1 protein by streptavidin beads in a competitive manner with LMB and vice versa. Mass spectrometric analysis shows that CBS9106 reacts with a synthetic CRM1 peptide that contains Cys528 but not with a Cys528 mutant peptide. Oral administration of CBS9106 significantly suppresses tumor growth and prolongs survival in mice bearing tumor xenograft without a significant loss in body weight. A reduced level of CRM1 protein is also observed in tumor xenografts isolated from mice treated with CBS9106. Taken together, these results indicate that CBS9106 is a novel reversible CRM1 inhibitor and a promising clinical candidate.',\n 'Topoisomerase IIalpha (topo IIalpha) is exported from the nucleus of human myeloma cells by a CRM1-dependent mechanism at cellular densities similar to those found in patient bone marrow. When topo IIalpha is trafficked to the cytoplasm, it is not in contact with the DNA; thus, topo IIalpha inhibitors are unable to induce DNA-cleavable complexes and cell death. Using a CRM1 inhibitor or a CRM1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA), we were able to block nuclear export of topo IIalpha as shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. Human myeloma cell lines and patient myeloma cells isolated from bone marrow were treated with a CRM1 inhibitor or CRM1-specific siRNA and exposed to doxorubicin or etoposide at high cell densities. CRM1-treated cell lines or myeloma patient cells were 4-fold more sensitive to topo II poisons as determined by an activated caspase assay. Normal cells were not significantly affected by CRM1-topo II inhibitor combination treatment. Cell death was correlated with increased DNA double-strand breaks as shown by the comet assay. Band depletion assays of CRM1 inhibitor-exposed myeloma cells showed increased topo IIalpha covalently bound to DNA. Topo IIalpha knockdown by a topo IIalpha-specific siRNA abrogated the CRM1-topo II therapy synergistic effect. These results suggest that blocking topo IIalpha nuclear export sensitizes myeloma cells to topo II inhibitors. This method of sensitizing myeloma cells suggests a new therapeutic approach to multiple myeloma.',\n 'Resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs is a major obstacle in the treatment of leukemia and multiple myeloma. We have previously found that myeloma and leukemic cells in transition from low-density log phase conditions to high-density plateau phase conditions export substantial amounts of endogenous topoisomerase II alpha from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. In order for topoisomerase-targeted chemotherapy to function, the topoisomerase target must have access to the nuclear DNA. Therefore, the nuclear export of topoisomerase II alpha may contribute to drug resistance, and defining this mechanism may lead to methods to preclude this avenue of resistance. We have identified nuclear export signals for topoisomerase II alpha at amino acids 1017-1028 and 1054-1066, using FITC-labeled BSA-export signal peptide conjugates microinjected into the nuclei of HeLa cells. Functional confirmation of both signals (1017-1028 and 1054-1066) was provided by transfection of human myeloma cells with plasmids containing the gene for a full-length human FLAG-topoisomerase fusion protein, mutated at hydrophobic amino acid residues in the export signals. Of the six putative export signals tested, the two sites above were found to induce export into the cytoplasm. Export by both signals was blocked by treatment of the cells with leptomycin B, indicating that a CRM-1-dependent pathway mediates export. Site-directed mutagenesis of two central hydrophobic residues in either export signal in full-length human topoisomerase blocked export of recombinant FLAG-topoisomerase II alpha, indicating that both signals may be required for export. Interestingly, this pair of nuclear export signals (1017-1028 and 1054-1066) also defines a dimerization domain of the topoisomerase II alpha molecule.']"

Several papers have reported that ureteral cancer is associated with worse prognosis.\\nTo investigate the prognostic significance of the presence of ureteral tumors in UUT-UC patients who underwent radical nephroureterectomy (RNU).\\nIn this multicenter retrospective study, 1068 eligible patients (median follow-up: 40 mo [interquartile range: 17-77 mo]) were divided into three groups based on tumor location: renal pelvic, ureteral, and both-regional (having both renal pelvic and ureteral tumors). The ureteral and both-regional groups were subsequently integrated into the ureteral involvement group to evaluate its prognostic impact.\\nAll patients underwent RNU.\\nThe prognostic impact of tumor location on survival was analyzed.\\nThe renal pelvic, ureteral, and both-regional groups consisted of 507 (47.5%), 430 (40.3%), and 131 (12.3%) patients, respectively. The ureteral and both-regional groups had a higher rate of lymphovascular invasion and lymph node metastasis compared with the renal pelvic group. The renal pelvic and both-regional tumors presented more frequently with locally advanced stages (pT3/T4) compared with the ureteral tumors. The 5-yr cancer-specific survival (CSS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients in the ureteral (70.5% and 66.7%, respectively) and both-regional groups (64.8% and 57.8%, respectively) were significantly worse than those in the renal pelvic group (81.9% and 78.1%, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, the presence of ureteral involvement was a significant prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.50; p=0.006) and PFS (HR: 1.35; p=0.023). This study is inherently limited by the biases associated with its retrospective and multicenter design.\\nThe presence of ureteral involvement had a significant impact on the survival of surgically treated UUT-UC patients associated with a poor prognosis.\\nWe demonstrated that the ureteral involvement was associated with poor survival compared with patients with renal pelvic tumor only in upper urinary tract urothelial patients treated by nephroureterectomy.',\n 'Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of urinary bladder cancer is the most common malignancy in the urinary system. Genetic instability is an essential property of malignant neoplasms and could be evaluated by microsatellite analysis. Alterations in numerous microsatellite loci are already described in urinary bladder TCC. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of only two microsatellite loci for the detection of bladder TCC, and their correlation with the major clinicopathological parameters.\\nWe analyzed the tissue samples derived from 70 patients with histopathologically confirmed TCC of the urinary bladder, collected by transurethral resection, and samples of normal bladder mucosa derived from 40 patients with nonmalignant diseases. Microsatellite alleles GSN and D18S51 were amplified in paired samples of tissue and leukocyte DNA from each patient, and were analyzed by electrophoresis.\\nMicrosatellite alterations at either GSN or D18S51locus, or in both, were detected in 46 out of the 70 patients (65.71 %) with TCC, but not in the patients of the control group. We found a significant statistical correlation between the frequencies of patients with microsatellite alterations in the examined loci and all three grades of histopathological T-classification. No significant correlation was found regarding the stages or the occurrence of recidivism, metastasis or cancer-related death within the two-year follow-up period.\\nThis study indicates that two selected microsatellite markers could have a potential value in clinical and pathological evaluation of urinary bladder TCC, especially regarding the prediction of tumor differentiation. Additional studies and further validation of the method are needed. Hippokratia 2015; 19 (3): 200-204.',\n 'Transitional cell carcinoma as a cause of hematuria is a rare entity in the pediatric age group. An 11-year-old child presented with gross, painless hematuria. Ultrasonogram and computed tomography scan of the child revealed a tumor in the posterolateral wall of the bladder. Cystoscopically, the mass was present in the bladder away from the trigone area about 2\\xa0cm lateral to the right ureteric orifice. Transurethrally, the tumor was excised by a cystoscope. Histopathologically, it was a low-grade noninvasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. A follow-up cystoscopy at 6\\xa0months and 1\\xa0year had no recurrence. Literature review revealed the pediatric age group as an uncommon age for urothelial carcinoma of bladder, which has a different biological behavior of being low malignant potential compared to their adult counterpart. They have been treated with transurethral resection of bladder tumor without any adjuvant therapy. There is no definite follow-up schedule for these tumors as it occurs in very small number of cases. ',\n 'The most common type of urinary bladder cancer is called as transitional cell carcinoma. The major risk factors for bladder cancer are environmental, tobacco smoking, exposure to toxic industrial chemicals and gases, bladder inflammation due to microbial and parasitic infections, as well as some adverse side-effects of medications. The genetic mutations in some chromosomal genes, such as FGFR3, RB1, HRAS, TP53, TSC1, and others, occur which form tumors in the urinary bladder. These genes play an important role in the regulation of cell division which prevents cells from dividing too quickly. The changes in the genes of human chromosome 9 are usually responsible for tumor in bladder cancer, but the genetic mutation of chromosome 22 can also result in bladder cancer. The identification of p53 gene mutation has been studied at NIH, Washington, DC, USA, in urine samples of bladder cancer patients. The invasive bladder cancers were determined for the presence of gene mutations on p53 suppressor gene. The 18 different bladder tumors were evaluated, and 11 (61\\xa0%) had genetic mutations of p53 gene. The bladder cancer studies have suggested that 70\\xa0% of bladder cancers involve a specific mutation in a particular gene, namely telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene. The TERT gene is involved in DNA protection, cellular aging processes, and cancer. The Urothelial carcinomas of the bladder have been described in Atlas of genetics and cytogenetics in oncology and hematology. HRAS is a proto-oncogene and has potential to cause cancer in several organs including the bladder. The TSC1 c. 1907 1908 del (E636fs) mutation in bladder cancer suggests that the location of the mutation is Exon 15 with frequency of TSC1 mutation of 11.7\\xa0%. The recent findings of BAP1 mutations have shown that it contributes to BRCA pathway alterations in bladder cancer. The discoveries of more gene mutations and new biomarkers and polymerase chain reaction bioassays for gene mutations in bladder cancer need further research. ',\n 'Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy is a complicated operation. The objective of this study is to present our technique and results of laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy.\\nA 72-year-old Thai male presented with gross hematuria. Cystoscope was performed. Large bladder tumor near right ureteric orifice was observed. Then, transurethral resection of bladder tumor was performed. His tumor pathology was muscle invasive high grade urothelial carcinoma with clinical staging T2N0M0. Laparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy was then conducted with bilateral pelvic nodes dissection and ileal conduit.\\nOperation period was eight hours. Blood loss was 500 ml. In pathological results, tumor invaded bladder muscle into perivesical tissue. Tumor margin was free. Lymph nodes were positive for malignancy 5/7 for right side and 0/4 for left side. Pathological staging was T3aN1M0. After post-operative period, the patient was discharged from hospital uneventfully.\\nLaparoscopic radical cystoprostatectomy in Maha Chakri Sirindhorn Medical Center is minimal invasive, feasible and safe. However, a longer follow-up period regarding long-term cancer control as well as functional and technical aspects will be required.',\n \"Spindle cell carcinoma, a rare variant of squamous cell carcinoma, has propensity to occur in the upper aero digestive tract, including the oral mucosa. In this oral pathology communication, we report the occurrence of this neoplasm in the left mandible as a large fleshy growth with destruction of bone in a 73-year-old Afro-Trinidadian female. The distinction of this tumor from other malignant spindle cell mesenchymal tumors is important. Selective sampling of this specimen for possible transitional areas of squamous and spindle cell appearance, immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin, vimentin, and S-100 protein are helpful in establishing the diagnosis. According to the patient's insistence, debulking of the tumor was performed under general anesthesia. Eight months later the patient succumbed to the disease. \",\n None,\n 'Increased telomerase activity is associated with almost all types of advanced human cancers with unknown molecular mechanism(s). Two recurrent point mutations in the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)--the key subunit of telomerase--have recently been identified in melanoma as well as a small sample of bladder cancer cell lines. However, the incidence and clinical-pathological significance of these mutations in urothelial carcinoma have not been well established yet. We collected 86 specimens of urothelial carcinoma including upper and lower urinary tract: high grade and low grade, invasive and noninvasive, and primary and metastatic. We also included some matched benign urothelium and common benign bladder lesions: cystitis, nephrogenic adenoma, and inverted papilloma. In addition, we collected urine samples for urothelial carcinoma workup; blood samples from patients underwent cystectomy with extensive lymphovascular invasion. All specimens were subject to polymerase chain reaction amplification and bidirectional Sanger sequencing for the TERT promoter mutations: C228T and C250T. We found that 64 (74%) of 86 carcinoma samples harbored 1 of the 2 TERT promoter mutations (C228T, n = 54; C250T, n = 10); the incidences were roughly equal regardless of site of origin, histologic grade, and invasive status. All matched benign and benign lesion samples showed wild-type sequence. These TERT promoter mutations are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma and are not associated with tumor locations, grade, or invasiveness. Importantly, the feasibility of detecting these mutations in urine samples may provide a novel method to detect urothelial carcinoma in urine.',\n 'The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of systemic inflammatory response has been proposed as a prognostic factor for patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) following radical cystectomy (RC).\\nTo validate NLR as a prognostic biomarker and to perform a pooled meta-analysis.\\nThe NLR was assessed in 4061 patients within 30 days before RC. A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using electronic databases.\\nAssociations with overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were evaluated using Cox models. Hazard ratios (HRs) were pooled in a meta-analysis using random-effects modeling.\\nA high NLR (≥2.7) was associated with advanced pathological tumor stages (p<0.001), lymph node involvement (p<0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p=0.008), and positive soft0tissue surgical margins (p=0.001). In multivariate analyses, a high NLR was independently associated with both OS (HR 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.22; p=0.029) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.07-1.37, p=0.003). The discrimination of the multivariate models increased by 0.2% on inclusion of NLR. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis. The HR for NLR greater than the cutoff was 1.46 (95% CI 1.01-1.92) for OS and 1.51 (95% CI 1.17-1.85) for CSS. Limitations include the retrospective study design and the lack of standardized follow-up.\\nIn patients with UCB treated with RC, a high preoperative NLR is associated with more advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis, and worse prognosis. The NLR may be a readily available and useful biomarker for preoperative prognostic stratification.\\nWe investigated the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a prognostic marker in patients with bladder cancer treated with radical cystectomy. We found that a high NLR is associated with worse oncologic outcomes, suggesting it could play a role in risk stratification.',\n 'The melanoma-associated antigen A (MAGE-A) family comprises cancer-testis antigens that represent promising prognostic biomarkers and immunotherapy targets in several cancer types. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of MAGE-A expression in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma in relation to clinicopathological features, lymphocytic infiltration, and clinical outcome. We immunohistochemically examined the expression of MAGE-A in 171 patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma. High (≥ 50% positive) and low MAGE-A expression levels were observed in 33 (19%) and 49 (29%) cases, respectively. MAGE-A was negative in 89 cases (52%). MAGE-A expression was positively correlated with high histologic grade; concomitant carcinoma in situ; higher Ki-67 proliferation index; and infiltration of CD3-, CD8-, and CD45RO-positive T lymphocytes, but not with CD20-positive B lymphocytes. High MAGE-A expression was significantly associated with shorter metastasis-free survival after nephroureterectomy (log-rank P = .019; multivariate hazard ratio, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.92). MAGE-A expression in metastatic lymph nodes was highly correlated with its expression in primary lesions. MAGE-A expression was retained in chemotherapy-resistant metachronous metastatic lesions of urothelial carcinoma. MAGE-A may be a promising prognostic biomarker and potential immunotherapeutic target for patients with upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.',\n 'In urothelial tumors of the urinary bladder, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)/neu expression has been reported over 10 years, but there is no clear correlation between prognosis and recurrence rate. The present study evaluates prognostic implication of HER-2/neu expression.\\nIn this study, 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of primary transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were processed. HER-2/neu monoclonal antibody immunohistochemistry staining procedure used for the study.\\nA total of 70 (70%) patients were positive for overexpression of HER-2/neu. HER-2/neu was positive in patients with 42 (70%) superficial tumor, 28 (70%) muscle invasive tumor, 41 (75.9%) high-grade tumor, 29 (63%) low grade tumor, 31 (68.9%) recurrent tumor, and 6 (66.6%) had positive lymph nodes.\\nHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu over expression was not correlated with the tumor stage, lymphnode metastasis or recurrence of the disease. HER-2/neu overexpression was statistically insignificantly correlated with the differentiation grade (P < 0.161) as compared to previous studies. Future studies on HER-2 expression with chemo-sensitivity and efficacy of HER-2-targeted therapies in urothelial carcinomas is needed.',\n None,\n 'We present a case of an 84-year-old man presenting with painless visible hematuria. Further investigation revealed a primary G3pT1 transitional cell carcinoma confined to a bladder diverticulum. In view of bladder-sparing therapy, he underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic bladder diverticulectomy with ureteral re-implantation. This report demonstrates a minimally invasive approach offering radical treatment without having to recur to partial or radical cystectomy. We discuss the operative steps, the significance of this case with a review of the literature, and the future potential this may represent for the treatment of tumor-containing bladder diverticula. ',\n 'To clarify the clinicopathological features of ovarian clear cell carcinoma derived from endometriotic cyst (EC-OCCC).\\nTotally 54 cases of EC-OCCC were recruited in the current retrospective study. The relation between ages, clinical symptoms and signs, surgical and pathological stages, serum CA125, findings of ultrasound, treatments and the sites of tumors, macro- and micro-features and expression of immunostainings were analyzed.\\n(1) Clinical features: the ages of patients were (50±6) years old (range 31-62 years old). Pelvic mass was the major complaint of 50 patients (93% , 50/54). Forty-five cases belonged to International federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage I, 4 cases were stage II and another 5 cases were stage III. Serum CA125 was elevated in 21 cases (54%, 21/39) before therapy. Doppler ultrasound showed 46 cases (85%, 46/54) had solid masses in pelvis. (2) Pathological findings: 52 cases (96%, 52/54) had their tumor unilaterally, and 2 cases (4%, 2/54) occurred bilaterally. The maximal diameters of endometriotic cyst (EC) ranged from 1.5 to 23.0 cm and maximal diameters of ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) components were from 0.5 to 12.0 cm. Fifty-one cases (94%, 51/54) had their tumor within EC, which showed focally irregular protrudings, grey-white papillae or solid nodules attached to the cyst wall. Three cases (6%, 3/54) appeared as irregular thickened wall of the cysts, ranged from 1.5 to 6.0 cm in the maximal length, with the microscopic features of EC and OCCC and the transitional areas between the 2 morphologies. All cases expressed cytokeratin (CK) 7 and pan-CK AE1/AE3, 17 cases (33%, 17/51) expressed ER and 5 cases (10%, 5/51) expressed PR. TP53 showed mutational phenotype in 19 cases (36%, 19/53). Sixteen cases (30%, 16/54) combined with uterine adenomyosis and 25 cases (46%, 25/54) with endometriosis at other sites. (3) Survival survey: during the period of 39.1 months follow-up, 3 cases relapsed and 2 cases died. (4) There was a significant difference of serum CA125 between patients of early-and advanced-stages (P=0.049). There were no differences identified in ages, diameters of EC and OCCC, the expression level of ER, PR and TP53, the co-existence of adenomyosis and endometrosis, as well as ultrasonic findings (P>0.05).\\nEC-OCCC could be recognized in early stage by symptoms and ultrasound due to accompanied endometriotic cysts, resulting in relatively good prognosis.',\n None,\n 'Aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in tumorigenesis. However, the role of miRNAs in bladder urothelial carcinoma still remains largely unknown. In this study, miR-199a-5p was validated to be significantly down-regulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma. In addition, restoring expression of miR-199a-5p inhibited the tumorigenesis of bladder urothelial carcinoma in vitro and in vivo by inducing the apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation of bladder cancerous cells. Further investigation reported that MLK3 was a direct target of miR-199a-5p. Moreover, the expression level of miR-199a-5p was conversely correlated with MLK3 in bladder cancerous cells. In addition, reintroduction of MLK3 was identified to promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptotic rate of cells, which have been altered by miR-199a-5p through activating the NF-κB pathway. All together, decrement of miR-199a-5p contributes to the tumorigenesis of bladder cancer by directly regulating MLK3/NF-κB pathway and miR-199a-5p might be developed as a therapeutic target for treatment of the bladder urothelial carcinoma. ',\n 'This study aimed to investigate the expression levels of urothelial carcinoma associated 1 (UCA1) in cancer tissues and plasma of colon cancer patients, and evaluate its clinical significance. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine the expression levels of UCA1 in 80 pairs of colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues, plasma samples from 20 healthy controls, 20 colon cancer patients before and after tumor removal. The relationships between UCA1 expression and clinical features and overall survival were analyzed. Compared with adjacent normal tissues, UCA1 was significantly upregulated in colon cancer tissues, especially in cases with LNM and advanced TNM stages (P < 0.05). High UCA1 expression was associated with LMN, higher pT category, and advanced TNM stages (P < 0.05). Patients with high UCA1 expression had worse survival time than those with low UCA1 expression (adjusted HR = 2.002, 95% CI 1.007-3.981, P = 0.048). Furthermore, plasma levels of UCA1 in colon cancer patients were significantly higher than those of controls (P = 0.016). There was significant difference in plasma level of UCA1 between samples taken before and after surgery (P = 0.048). In conclusion, tissue expression of UCA1 is related to prognosis in colon cancer. Plasma UCA1 may serve as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and disease monitoring of colon cancer patients. ',\n 'Astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) and Cyclin D1 is associated with tumorigenesis and progression. The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of AEG-1 and Cyclin D1 in human bladder urothelial carcinoma (BUC) and explore their clinical and pathological significance.\\nThe expression of AEG-1 and Cyclin D1 protein were detected in 85 cases of human BUC and 16 cases of tumor-adjacent tissues by the immunohistochemical method.\\nThe positive expression level of AEG-1 was 61.2% in human BUC which was higher than that in tumor-adjacent tissues (18.8%), P=0.002. The high expression of AEG-1 protein was correlated with the recurrence group (P=0.004). The positive rate of AEG-1 protein in superficial carcinoma group was lower than that of invasive cancer group (P=0.014). The positive expression level of Cyclin D1 was 56.5% in BUC, which was higher than that in tumor-adjacent tissues (12.5%). P=0.001. The high expression of Cyclin D1 protein was correlated with the recurrence group (P=0.024). The positive rate of Cyclin D1 protein in low grade group was lower than that of high grade group (P=0.001). The positive rate of Cyclin D1 protein in superficial carcinoma group was lower than that of invasive carcinoma group, (P=0.012). AEG-1 protein was positively correlated with Cyclin D1 protein (r=0.567, P<0.001). The log-rank test statistical analysis suggested that patients with higher AEG-1 or Cyclin D1 expression had shorter overall survival time, while patients with lower AEG-1 or Cyclin D1 expression had better survival.\\nOverexpression of AEG-1 and Cyclin D1 are markedly correlated with TNM stage and recurrence of BUC. Cyclin D1 are markedly correlated with grade of BUC. Detection of AEG-1 and Cyclin D1 may be helpful to evaluate prognosis and infiltrative capability of BUC.',\n 'Urinary bladder paragangliomas are rare with a reported incidence of <1% of bladder tumors. In the absence of typical clinical features, histopathology helps in rendering definitive diagnosis. We describe a case of nonfunctional urinary bladder paraganglioma in a 28-year-old male who presented with the chief complaint of abdominal pain. The final diagnosis was made by histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. It is important to distinguish paraganglioma from urothelial carcinoma as the treatment differs. This is an additional case of nonfunctional urinary bladder paraganglioma in a male patient with a brief review of the literature. ',\n 'While the majority of individuals with Costello syndrome share characteristic findings affecting multiple organ systems, the phenotypic spectrum is wide, ranging from a milder or attenuated phenotype to a severe phenotype with early lethal complications. Costello syndrome is typically characterized by failure to thrive in infancy as a result of severe postnatal feeding difficulties; short stature; developmental delay or intellectual disability; coarse facial features (full lips, large mouth, full nasal tip); curly or sparse, fine hair; loose, soft skin with deep palmar and plantar creases; papillomata of the face and perianal region; diffuse hypotonia and joint laxity with ulnar deviation of the wrists and fingers; tight Achilles tendons; and cardiac involvement including: cardiac hypertrophy (usually typical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), congenital heart defect (usually valvar pulmonic stenosis), and arrhythmia (usually supraventricular tachycardia, especially chaotic atrial rhythm/multifocal atrial tachycardia or ectopic atrial tachycardia). Relative or absolute macrocephaly is typical, and postnatal cerebellar overgrowth can result in the development of a Chiari I malformation with associated anomalies including hydrocephalus or syringomyelia. Individuals with Costello syndrome have an approximately 15% lifetime risk for malignant tumors including rhabdomyosarcoma and neuroblastoma in young children and transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder in adolescents and young adults.\\nThe diagnosis of Costello syndrome is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous \\nCostello syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

AMACR is also a fairly sensitive marker for papillary renal cell carcinoma. Papillary adenoma associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma are AMACR positive and both represent a continuum of the same biological process. However, the papillary adenomas associated with end-kidney and/or acquired cystic disease are AMACR negative. Herein, we report a case of AMACR positive renal adenomatosis with tiny foci of papillary carcinoma in a background of end stage kidney disease and nephrolithiasis. AMACR staining pattern in renal papillary adenomas needs more evaluation to better understand their pathogenesis under different settings.',\n 'Apart from an invasive biopsy, currently no tools are available to confirm the diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC); this resulted in approximately 30% of patients being diagnosed with metastatic disease.\\nTo determine whether urinary microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as biomarkers to confirm the diagnosis of ccRCC.\\nGlobal miRNA expression was assessed in 28 preoperative urine samples from patients with ccRCC and 18 healthy participants. The independent validation set consisted of 81 ccRCC patients, 24 patients with benign lesions, and 33 healthy participants. We extracted both cell-free and exosomal RNA for miRNA expression analysis using miRNA-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. We also investigated exosomal miRNA secretion in cell line models and performed exosome transfer between RCC and endothelial cell types.\\nReceiver operating characteristic analysis was applied to identify the discrimination power of miRNAs.\\nOverall, miR-126-3p combined with miR-449a or with miR-34b-5p could significantly distinguish ccRCC patients from healthy participants (miR-126-3p-miR-449a: area under the curve [AUC]: 0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7620-0.9151; p<0.001; miR-126-3p-miR-34b-5p: AUC: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.7013-0.8815; p<0.001). The combination of miR-126-3p and miR-34b-5p was also able to distinguish small renal masses (pT1a, ≤4cm) from healthy controls (AUC: 0.79; 95% CI, 0.6848-0.8980; p<0.001). Using miR-126-3p and miR-486-5p in combination, we were able to differentiate between benign lesions and ccRCC (AUC: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.7295-0.9615; p<0.01). The expression of a number of miRNAs returned to a level comparable with health after surgery. Kidney cancer cell lines were found to secrete exosomal miR-126-3p, miR-17-5p, miR-21-3p, and miR-25-3p, and these miRNAs were found to be internalized by other cell types.\\nWe identified exosomal miRNAs as potential noninvasive diagnostic urinary biomarkers for ccRCC and provided evidence that miRNAs are secreted by the tumor and can function as a tool for intercellular communication.\\nWe identified urinary microRNAs that can serve as diagnostic biomarkers for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.',\n 'Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-directed therapies are the standard of care in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) but are not used based on molecular subclassifications of ccRCC.\\nTo determine if an association exists between genomic alterations (GAs) detected by comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in the course of clinical care and the response to anti-VEGF receptor (VEGFR) and anti-MTOR pathway targeted therapies in a cohort of patients with treated mccRCC.\\nCGP, using a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified platform, was performed on 31 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue specimens (84% from cytoreductive nephrectomies) obtained from patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had received VEGFR and/or mTOR inhibitors. Duration of treatment (DOT) and extent and duration of clinical response were obtained from review of medical records.\\nAll classes of GAs-base substitutions, short insertions, deletions, gene fusions, rearrangements, and copy number-were assessed via hybrid capture-based CGP. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the frequency of GAs in groups segregated by the DOT with VEGF-directed agents.\\nThe most common GAs detected in this series were in VHL (70%), PBRM1 (48%), SETD2 (32%), TSC1 (29%), MLL (19%), TERT (16%), ARID1B (16%), and KDM5C (16%). Across 61 administrations of VEGF-directed therapy in 27 patients, exceptional responses (DOT >21 mo) were more frequent among patients with GAs in KDM5C, PBRM1, and VHL. Conversely, these patients also featured a lower frequency of GA associated with response to mTOR-directed therapy, such as TSC1.\\nMolecular subclassifications may affect response to VEGF-directed therapy. The predictive and prognostic nature of these molecular subclassifications in the metastatic setting should be explored in an extended series.\\nComprehensive genomic profiling in the course of clinical care in the community oncology setting can delineate subgroups of patients with advanced kidney cancer who stand to benefit more from specific molecular-targeted agents.',\n 'Prediction of outcomes in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is crucial for clinical decision-making. The limited accuracy of conventional prognostic factors such as stage and grade may be increased by the use of biomarkers.\\nTo evaluate the association of serum adiponectin and leptin and polymorphisms in the leptin and leptin receptor genes with RCC histopathology and prognosis.\\nAdiponectin and leptin levels were measured in preoperative serum samples from 131 consecutive patients with sporadic unilateral RCC. The polymorphisms G-2548A (rs7799039) in the leptin gene (LEP) and Gln223Arg (Q223R, A668G, rs1137101) in the leptin receptor gene (LEPR) were genotyped in 233 patients.\\nMultivariable associations with RCC-specific survival were analyzed using Cox models.\\nMedian preoperative serum adiponectin was 15.8μg/ml (interquartile range 10.0-23.1). Adiponectin was lower in patients with distant metastases (p=0.017) or histologic tumor necrosis (p=0.015). On multivariable analysis adjusted for the effects of variables in the Karakiewicz nomogram, each 1-μg/ml increase in adiponectin was associated with a 8% decrease in the hazard of death from RCC (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% confidence interval 0.86-0.98; p=0.007). The discrimination of the Karakiewicz nomogram increased by 0.6% on inclusion of adiponectin. Leptin levels, LEP G-2548A and LEPR Q223R were not associated with either RCC pathology or outcomes. Limitations include the retrospective study design, the low numbers of patients, and a lack of standardized follow-up.\\nThis study suggests that lower preoperative serum adiponectin is associated with features of biologically aggressive RCC, metastasis, and survival.\\nWe assessed the relationship between outcomes and blood levels of adiponectin and leptin and genetic changes in leptin and leptin receptor genes. We found that patients with lower adiponectin levels have more aggressive tumors and poorer survival.',\n 'Two risk models, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) model and the International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) model, have been studied in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with targeted therapy.\\nTo validate externally the predictive accuracies of the MSKCC and IMDC models for prognosis in mRCC patients treated with first-line and subsequent second-line targeted therapy.\\nA total of 311 patients were assessed retrospectively.\\nAll patients underwent targeted therapy.\\nSurvival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The predictive ability was evaluated using the c-index.\\nRegarding to the first-line targeted therapy, the 3-yr overall survival (OS) rates of the MSKCC (p<0.001) and IMDC models (p<0.001) were 76.2% and 77.3%, respectively, in the favorable-risk group; 46.7% and 47.9%, respectively, in the intermediate-risk group; and 13.4% and 15.6%, respectively, in the poor-risk group. The c-indexes were 0.68 for the MSKCC model and 0.69 for the IMDC model in a first-line setting. Regarding the second-line targeted therapy, the 1-yr OS rates of the MSKCC (p<0.001) and IMDC models (p<0.001) were 80.9% and 90.5%, respectively, in the favorable-risk group; 71.4% and 70.6%, respectively, in the intermediate-risk group; and 31.7% and 24.6%, respectively, in the poor-risk group. The c-indexes were 0.66 for the MSKCC model and 0.65 for the IMDC model in the second-line setting. The study is limited by its retrospective nature.\\nThe results may assist physicians in providing more appropriate patient counseling and imply the need for a future prognostic tool in mRCC treated with targeted therapy.\\nBoth risk models were useful for the risk stratification in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with first-line and second-line targeted therapy; however, it might be necessary to further update or optimize the models for our Japanese cohort of mRCC patients.',\n 'Cervical cancer usually presents in advanced stages and is treated with chemoradiation. About 15-20\\xa0% patients present with local recurrence after chemoradiation. Radical surgical resection is the only treatment modality offering long term survival benefit in recurrent cervical cancer. The most common surgical option for these patients is pelvic exenteration. Radical hysterectomy may be done for patients with a small centrally located recurrence in the cervix with no infiltration of adjacent structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and survival outcome following radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cancer cervix. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our patients who underwent surgery for cancer cervix recurrence from January 2010 to December 2014. The postoperative morbidity was considered early if it happened in the initial 30\\xa0days of surgery and late if it occurred after 30\\xa0days. All patients were followed up till February 2015. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan- Meir method. Between January 2010 and December 2014, 20 patients with recurrent cervical cancer underwent radical surgical resection. The median age of the study group was 43\\xa0years (range 28-63\\xa0years). Seventeen patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 3 had adenocarcinoma. 13 underwent pelvic exenteration and 7 patients underwent radical type 2 hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphnode dissection. In the exenteration group, 8 patients had anterior exenteration, 4 had total exenteration and one had posterior exenteration. Urinary diversion was done by ileal conduit in 8 patients, double barrel colostomy in two and wet colostomy in two patients. There were no immediate postoperative deaths. Operating time, blood transfusions needed and hospital stay was more in the exenteration group compared to radical hysterectomy patients. After pelvic exenteration post-operative complications were seen in 76.9\\xa0% of which the most common was of the urinary tract including 3 patients with pyelonephritis, 5 had renal insufficiency and 2 patients developed urinary fistulae. Post-operative morbidity was lower in radical hysterectomy patients. There were two patients in the hysterectomy group who developed vault recurrence while none in the exenteration group had local recurrence. The median follow up time was 19\\xa0months (range 9-53\\xa0months).Three year overall survival for the entire cohort was 43\\xa0%. Median survival time for the exenteration group was 28\\xa0months which was significantly higher than 14\\xa0months for the radical hysterectomy group. This study shows that radical surgical resection is feasible with good survival outcome and acceptable morbidity in recurrent cancer cervix patients. Radical hysterectomy can be done in selected patients but pelvic exenteration has better long-term survival but with the potential for both short- & long-term complications.',\n 'We present a case of a multifocal kidney transplant renal cell carcinoma in a 35-year-old lady, presenting 16\\xa0years after kidney transplantation, diagnosed during investigation of recurrent urinary tract infections.

This case reinforces the fact that immunosuppressive therapy has made kidney transplantation possible; however, it is accompanied by a higher incidence of malignancy. It also reinforces the importance of lifelong screening of both native and renal transplant grafts.',\n 'The ',\n None,\n 'von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited multi systemic cancer syndrome that is classically associated with neoplasms in multiple organs, and caused by mutations in the ',\n 'The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes from our initial experience with laparoscopic nephron sparing surgery (LNSS) for small renal masses in Australian practice.\\nA retrospective review was performed on an initial 50 patients undergoing LNSS. All procedures performed between April 2006 and September 2012 were included with median follow-up of 30 months. Outcomes measured were: positive surgical margin, warm ischaemic time, total operative time, blood transfusion and complications in the first 30 days after surgery.\\nThe mean age of patients was 57 years. The mean pre-operative creatinine was 85\\u2009μmol/L and the mean post-operative creatinine was 89\\u2009μmol/L. Sixty-four\\u2009per\\u2009cent of the tumours were malignant tumours. The mean size of tumours was 2.5\\u2009cm. There were two malignant positive surgical margins on histology. The mean total operative time was 224\\u2009min and the mean warm ischaemic time was 24\\u2009min. Nine patients had complications with Clavien-Dindo grade III or lower. There was no grade IV or V complication. No patients were lost to follow-up and there have been no tumour recurrences to date.\\nLNSS is emerging as a viable alternative to open NSS for small renal tumours with lower morbidity and equivalent oncological and functional outcomes. There is, however, a steep learning curve associated with the procedure.',\n 'To characterize patients experiencing late recurrence after primary radical surgery for renal cell carcinoma and to approach the mechanism of late recurrence.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed 657 consecutive patients who underwent radical surgery for pathologically confirmed ≤stage III renal cell carcinoma in a single institution between January 1981 and December 2008. Early or late recurrence was defined as a recurrence occurring before or after 60 months after primary surgery.\\nOf 657 patients, 96 (14.6%) experienced early recurrence, and 41 (6.2%) developed late recurrence. Patients with late recurrence had smaller diameter of primary tumor (median 5 cm vs 8 cm, P < 0.001), lower pathological stage (P < 0.001) and lower nuclear grade (P = 0.004) at primary surgery than those with early recurrence. On multivariate analysis, vascular invasion (including microscopic and gross invasion) was the predictor of late recurrence (P < 0.01, HR 3.79). Overall survival and disease-specific survival after recurrence were longer in patients with late recurrence (median 64 and 76 months, respectively) than in those with early recurrence (34.5 and 35 months, respectively; P = 0.008 and 0.002).\\nThese results suggest that micrometastasis at the time of surgery associated with vascular invasion at primary tumor site and their relatively lower malignant potential could lead to late recurrence. Further studies are warranted for better understanding and managing late recurrence of renal cell carcinoma.',\n None,\n 'Cabozantinib is orally available kinase inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is used in treatment of advanced, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer and refractory renal cell carcinoma.

Blistering may be severe and granulation tissue can form on the skin around the oral and nasal cavities, fingers and toes, and internally around the upper airway. Blisters generally heal with no significant scarring. Broad classification of JEB includes JEB generalized severe and JEB generalized intermediate. In JEB generalized severe, blisters are present at birth or become apparent in the neonatal period. Congenital malformations of the urinary tract and bladder may also occur. In JEB generalized intermediate, the phenotype may be mild with blistering localized to hands, feet, knees, and elbows with or without renal or ureteral involvement. Some individuals never blister after the newborn period. Additional features shared by JEB and the other major forms of epidermolysis bullosa (EB) include congenital localized absence of skin (aplasia cutis congenita), milia, nail dystrophy, scarring alopecia, hypotrichosis, pseudosyndactyly, and other contractures.\\nThe diagnosis of JEB is established in a proband with characteristic clinical findings by molecular genetic testing that identifies biallelic pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with JEB: \\nJEB is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected child are usually obligate heterozygotes (i.e., carriers). Because germline mosaicism and uniparental isodisomy have been reported, carrier status of parents needs to be confirmed with molecular genetic testing. At conception, each sib of an affected individual whose parents are both carriers has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. The offspring of an individual with autosomal recessive JEB are obligate heterozygotes (carriers) for a pathogenic variant. Carrier testing for family members at increased risk and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in the family.',\n 'The aim of this report is to assess the added benefit of axitinib compared with sorafenib as appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after failure of prior treatment with a cytokine (cytokine population) and everolimus as ACT after failure of prior treatment with sunitinib (sunitinib population). The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. Direct comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the assessment.',\n 'Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has developed over the last few years for the treatment of primary and metastatic hepatic tumors. The tumoral and adjacent peritumoral modifications caused by this radiosurgery limit the evaluation of response by anatomic imaging and dimensional criteria alone, such as with RECIST. This suggests that it is of interest to also take into account the residual enhancement and hyper metabolism of these hepatic targets. We have reviewed the English language literature regarding the response of hepatic lesions treated by SBRT, and found that only seven articles were specifically concerned with this problem. The response of the hepatocellular carcinoma after SBRT has been studied specifically with multiphase enhanced CT-scan. Criteria set by the European Association of Study of the Liver better estimate response at each time point of follow up than RECIST does. Non-enhancement, reflecting tumor necrosis, is additionally an early indicator of response with extended response in time and a best non-enhancement percentage is observed at 12 months. The response after treatment by SBRT of cholangiocarcinoma has not yet generated a specific report. Use of RECIST criteria is also inadequate in the evaluation of response after SBRT for hepatic metastases. Response of liver metastases to SBRT is better assessed with a combination of size and enhancement pattern. The occurrence of a lobulated enhancement during follow up is efficient to predict local progression in a specific, reproducible, and sensitive way. Patients with FDG-avid hepatic metastases are also better evaluated with PET-CT and functional criteria than routine imaging and metric evaluation alone.',\n 'There is 25-35% mutation rate of p53 in cancerous neural cells and this rate reaches 70-76% in glioma cell line. Complement of wild-type p53 has become a potential strategy for protein therapy of cancerous neural cells. Here we investigated the feasibility of a novel RDP-p53 fusion protein for anti-proliferation of cancerous neural cell and the possible mechanism, which would provide an effective approach for targeted delivery of p53 protein to treat cancerous neural cells.\\nThe RDP-p53 fusion proteins are expressed in Escherichia coli, and they are labeled with FITC and rhodamine B by chemical modification. The fluorescence-labeled proteins are added to human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG-2) and human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) in order to investigate the possibility of RDP enhancing the cell uptake efficiency into neural cells as a cell-permeable carrier. The inhibitory effect of RDP-p53 on SH-SY5Y and human glioma cells (U251) was evaluated by MTT assay. Moreover, the anti-proliferation mechanism of RDP-p53 was determined by Apoptosis and Necrosis Assay Kit and flow cytometric analysis.\\nThe results showed that RDP-p53 could enter SH-SY5Y cells with high efficiency and selectively inhibit the growth of cancerous neural cells, including SH-SY5Y and U251. Also, cell apoptosis pathway and cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase were associated with the inhibition mechanism of RDP-p53 according to the data of flow cytometric analysis.\\nRDP-p53 could be a novel antitumor candidate for targeting treatment of cancerous neural cells.',\n 'Deciphering genomic diversity could improve clinical care for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

',\n 'Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain major health problems worldwide, with 400-500 million chronically infected people worldwide. Chronic infection results in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the second leading cause of cancer death. Current treatments for HBV limit viral replication without efficiently curing infection. HCV treatment has markedly progressed with the licensing of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV cure, yet limited access for the majority of patients is a major challenge. Preventative and curative treatment strategies, aimed at novel targets, are needed for both viruses. Viral entry represents one such target, although detailed knowledge of the entry mechanisms is a prerequisite. For HBV, the recent discovery of the NTCP cell entry factor enabled the establishment of an HBV cell culture model and showed that cyclosporin A and Myrcludex B are NTCP-targeting entry inhibitors. Advances in the understanding of HCV entry revealed it to be a complex process involving many factors, offering several antiviral targets. These include viral envelope proteins E1 and E2, virion-associated lipoprotein ApoE, and cellular factors CD81, SRBI, EGFR, claudin-1, occludin, and the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1. Small molecules targeting SR-BI, EGFR, and NPC1L1 have entered clinical trials, whereas other viral- and host-targeted small molecules, peptides, and antibodies show promise in preclinical models. This review summarizes the current understanding of HBV and HCV entry and describes novel antiviral targets and compounds in different stages of clinical development. Overall, proof-of-concept studies indicate that entry inhibitors are a promising class of antivirals to prevent and treat HBV and HCV infections. ',\n 'Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. It was reported to account for about 4.7\\xa0% of chronic liver disease in Egyptian patients. The present study aimed at studying the different factors that may be implicated in the relationship of schistosomiasis mansoni with HCC in Egypt. A total of 75 Egyptian patients with primary liver tumours (HCC) were enrolled in this study. They were subjected to full history taking and indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. According to the results, the patients were categorized into two groups: Group I: 29 patients with negative IHA for schistosomiasis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) positive with no history or laboratory evidence of previous or current Schistosoma mansoni infection. Group II: 46 patients with positive IHA for schistosomiasis and HCV positive. The significant higher proportion of HCC patients in the present study had concomitant HCV and schistosomiasis (61.3\\xa0%) compared to HCC patients with HCV alone (38.7\\xa0%) suggesting that the co-infection had increased the incidence of HCC among these patients. Analysis of the age distribution among HCC patients revealed that patients in Group II were younger in age at time of diagnosis of HCC with mean age 57.1\\xa0years, as compared to patients in Group I with mean age 64.3\\xa0years with a highly significant statistical difference between the 2 groups. HCC in Group II was more common in rural residents while it was more common in urban areas in Group I with a significant statistical difference between the 2 groups. Analysis of the sex distribution among the studied groups showed that HCC was more common in males than females in both groups. As regards the aggression of HCC, it was more commonly multifocal and larger in size in patients with concomitant infection than in patients with HCV alone. ',\n 'Variegate porphyria (VP) is both a cutaneous porphyria (with chronic blistering skin lesions) and an acute porphyria (with severe episodic neurovisceral symptoms). The most common manifestation of VP is adult-onset cutaneous blistering lesions (subepidermal vesicles, bullae, and erosions that crust over and heal slowly) of sun-exposed skin, especially the hands and face. Other chronic skin findings include milia, scarring, thickening, and areas of decreased and increased skin pigmentation. Facial hyperpigmentation and hypertrichosis may occur. Cutaneous manifestations may improve in winter and be less prevalent in northern regions and in dark-skinned individuals. Acute neurovisceral symptoms can occur any time after puberty, but less often in the elderly. Acute manifestations are highly variable, but may be similar from episode to episode in a person with recurrent attacks; not all manifestations are present in a single episode; and acute symptoms may become chronic. Symptoms are more common in women than men. The most common manifestations are abdominal pain; constipation; pain in the back, chest, and extremities; anxiety; seizures; and a primarily motor neuropathy resulting in muscle weakness that may progress to quadriparesis and respiratory paralysis. Psychiatric disturbances and autonomic neuropathy can also be observed. Acute attacks may be severe and are potentially fatal.\\nThe biochemical diagnosis of VP is established in an individual with elevated urine porphobilinogen (PBG) or porphyrins and a fluorescence peak at ~626 nm on plasma fluorescence scanning; fecal porphyrins are also elevated, with a predominance of coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin.

Many synthetic androgenic steroids are capable of causing cholestatic liver injury and long term use of androgens is associated with development of liver tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma and hepatic adenoma.',\n 'The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small RNA virus belonging to the family flavividirae and genus hepacivirus. The virion is approximately 50 nm in diameter and has an outer lipid associated envelop (E1 and E2) and inner nucleocapsid (Core). Within the nucleocapsid is a single molecule of single-stranded RNA of positive polarity approximately 9.5 kilobases in length. The RNA is transcribed into a large polyprotein that is subsequently cleaved into multiple polypeptides, labeled from the 5’ to 3’ end: core, envelope 1 and 2, and nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4 and NS5A and NS5B. The NS3 region encodes a viral helicase and protease. The NS5A region encodes a polypeptide that is essential for production and maintenance of the replicative complex. The NS5B region encodes a viral RNA dependent, RNA polymerase that is essential for replication. The NS3, NS5A and NS5B regions have been targeted with direct acting antiviral agents. The initial agents used to treat chronic hepatitis C were interferon alfa, peginterferon and ribavirin. The antiviral activity of interferon and peginterferon is based upon their ability to stimulate interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) that have endogenous antiviral activities. Ribavirin is a nucleoside analogue that potentiates the effects of interferon against hepatitis C by as yet undefined mechanisms. Until 2010, the standard therapy of chronic hepatitis C was the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin given for 24 or 48 weeks. This combination led to sustained clearance of HCV and remission in disease in 40% to 50% of patients. Response rates were higher with certain HCV genotypes, so that response rates in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 were as high as 70% to 80%. Importantly, these remissions in disease have been shown to represent cure of the chronic viral infection, in that long term follow up demonstrated lack of HCV replication and resolution of disease activity in over 98% of patients. The shortcomings of peginterferon-ribavirin therapy were significant, most importantly the poor tolerance and side effects of this regimen. Thus, a high proportion of patients was intolerant or had contraindications to treatment. In 2010, three HCV-specific protease inhibitors were approved for use and introduced into practice: boceprevir, telaprevir and simeprevir. All three of these were specific to genotype 1 HCV and had little or no activity against genotypes 2 or 3 or the lesser common genotypes 4, 5 and 6. Triple therapy with peginterferon, ribavirin and a HCV-specific protease inhibitor (boceprevir, telaprevir or simeprevir) increased the response rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1 from 40%-45% to 65%-75%. A persistent difficulty, however, was the continued need to combine these agents with peginterferon and the considerable side effects which were worsened by these protease inhibitors. An important advance in therapy of hepatitis C came in 2013 with the approval of an HCV specific RNA polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir. Sofosbuvir not only increased the response rate when combined with peginterferon and ribavirin, but also allowed for interferon-free treatment when combined with ribavirin, HCV protease inhibitors or a new class of agents that antagonized HCV NS5A activity. In 2014, all-oral HCV specific antiviral regimens were approved that yielded response rates in excess of 95% in patients with genotype 1. Furthermore, successful therapy required only 8 to 12 weeks of treatment in most patients. These all-oral regimens revolutionized therapy of hepatitis C, allowing treatment of virtually all patients regardless of severity of illness or co-morbid conditions with few side effects and durations of therapy of 8, 12 or 24 weeks. Other all oral regimens, including treatments for the less common genotypes of hepatitis C began to become available in 2015, 2016 and 2017. The several classes of agents that are combined in either a two-, three- or four-drug regimens include HCV RNA polymerase inhibitors (nucleoside and nonnucleoside), HCV NS5A antagonists and the HCV protease inhibitors. In the future, other steps in the HCV replicative cycle may yield additional targets for small molecule therapy. Widespread application of these therapies to patients with chronic hepatitis C will likely decrease the morbidity and mortality of this disease and make significant inroads into decreasing the burden of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.',\n 'Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that is used in the therapy of refractory metastatic colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

These side effects are more common with higher doses of estrogens, as were used in the early high dose estrogen formulation of oral contraceptives, but they have also been described with use of more modern birth control pills and with low dose, estrogen hormonal replacement therapy.',\n 'Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 (SGBS1) is characterized by pre- and postnatal macrosomia; distinctive craniofacial features (including macrocephaly, coarse facial features, macrostomia, macroglossia, and palatal abnormalities); and commonly, mild to severe intellectual disability with or without structural brain anomalies. Other variable findings include supernumerary nipples, diastasis recti / umbilical hernia, congenital heart defects, diaphragmatic hernia, genitourinary defects, and gastrointestinal anomalies. Skeletal anomalies can include vertebral fusion, scoliosis, rib anomalies, and congenital hip dislocation. Hand anomalies can include large hands and postaxial polydactyly. Affected individuals are at increased risk for embryonal tumors, including Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, adrenal neuroblastoma, gonadoblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and medulloblastoma.\\nThe diagnosis of SGBS1 is established in a male proband with suggestive findings and/or a hemizygous pathogenic variant in \\nSimpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome type 1 is inherited in an X-linked manner. If the mother of the proband has a pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting the pathogenic variant in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected. Females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers, although due to X-chromosome inactivation, carrier females may have manifestations of SGBS1. Males with SGBS1 will pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible for families in which the pathogenic variant has been identified.',\n 'Hereditary coproporphyria (HCP) is an acute (hepatic) porphyria in which the acute symptoms are neurovisceral and occur in discrete episodes. Attacks typically start in the abdomen with low-grade pain that slowly increases over a period of days (not hours) with nausea progressing to vomiting. In some individuals, the pain is predominantly in the back or extremities. When an acute attack is untreated, a motor neuropathy may develop over a period of days or a few weeks. The neuropathy first appears as weakness proximally in the arms and legs, then progresses distally to involve the hands and feet. Some individuals experience respiratory insufficiency due to loss of innervation of the diaphragm and muscles of respiration. Acute attacks are associated commonly with use of certain medications, caloric deprivation, and changes in female reproductive hormones. About 20% of those with an acute attack also experience photosensitivity associated with bullae and skin fragility.\\nThe most sensitive and specific biochemical screening test for any one of the acute porphyrias (including HCP) during an acute attack is a striking increase in urinary porphobilinogen. Quantitative analysis of porphyrins in both urine and feces is essential to distinguish between the different acute porphyrias and establish the diagnosis of HCP. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in \\nHCP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with low penetrance. Most individuals with HCP have an affected parent; the proportion with a ',\n 'Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is closely associated with progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We reported that melanocortin 4 receptor–deficient mice (MC4R-KO mice), when fed a high-fat diet, provide a novel rodent model of NASH. Recently, we have identified a unique histological feature termed “hepatic crown-like structures” (hCLS) in the livers of MC4R-KO mice and NASH patients. In hCLS, CD11c-positive macrophages aggregate to surround hepatocytes with large lipid droplets, similar to the “crown-like structure (CLS)” described in obese adipose tissue. Interestingly, we have recently reported that macrophage-induced C-type lectin (Mincle) is involved in CLS formation and fibrogenic gene expression in obese adipose tissue, suggesting the pathophysiologic role of CLS in obesity-induced adipose tissue fibrosis. Collectively, our data provide evidence that hCLS serves as an origin of hepatic inflammation and fibrosis during the progression from simple steatosis to NASH and thus helps in elucidation of the pathogenesis of NASH, pursuit of specific biomarkers, and evaluation of potential therapeutic strategies.',\n 'The tremendous progress in understanding the mechanisms of tissue fibrosis has led to realistic hopes for effective antifibrotic therapies in a range of diseases, including hepatic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and renal fibrosis, as well as fibrotic disorders of muscle, heart, skin and bone marrow. Common mechanisms across these different tissues have unearthed targets that may be relevant to many organs. Best understood are pathways leading to hepatic fibrosis, which also predispose to hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatic stellate cells are the principal fibrogenic cells in the liver following their activation into myofibroblasts, and their detailed characterization has unearthed many targets for therapy. Increasingly, investigators now rely on genetic mouse models to define contributions of specific molecules, in hopes of antagonizing these molecules as therapeutic targets. Both genomic and molecular approaches are unveiling new patterns of gene expression and molecules. A robust framework for antifibrotic drug discovery has been developed, and many agents are in clinical trials. With iterative evaluation of drug candidates in both animal models and humans, accelerated progress in bringing these drugs to patients is anticipated.',\n 'The diagnosis of ',\n 'Untreated tyrosinemia type I usually presents either in young infants with severe liver involvement or later in the first year with liver dysfunction and renal tubular dysfunction associated with growth failure and rickets. Untreated children may have repeated, often unrecognized, neurologic crises lasting one to seven days that can include change in mental status, abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, and/or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Death in the untreated child usually occurs before age ten years, typically from liver failure, neurologic crisis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Combined treatment with nitisinone and a low-tyrosine diet has resulted in a greater than 90% survival rate, normal growth, improved liver function, prevention of cirrhosis, correction of renal tubular acidosis, and improvement in secondary rickets.\\nTyrosinemia type I results from deficiency of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetase (FAH). The diagnosis is established in a proband with typical biochemical findings (increased succinylacetone concentration in the blood and urine; elevated plasma concentrations of tyrosine, methionine, and phenylalanine; and elevated urinary concentration of tyrosine metabolites and the compound δ-ALA) and/or by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in \\nTyrosinemia type I is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants in a family are known.',\n 'Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is characterized by an increased risk for: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (i.e., emphysema, persistent airflow obstruction, and/or chronic bronchitis) in adults; liver disease in children and adults; panniculitis; and c-ANCA positive vasculitis. Emphysema, sometimes with associated bronchiectasis, is the most common manifestation of AATD. Smoking is the major factor influencing the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The onset of respiratory disease in smokers with AATD is characteristically between ages 40 and 50 years; in non-smokers, the onset can be delayed to the sixth decade, and some non-smokers never develop COPD. Non-smokers may have a normal life span. Although reported, emphysema in children with AATD is extremely rare. AATD-associated liver disease, which is present in only a small portion of affected children, manifests as obstructive jaundice and increased serum aminotransferase levels in the early days and months of life. The incidence of liver disease increases with age. Liver disease in adults (manifesting as cirrhosis and fibrosis) may occur in the absence of a history of neonatal or childhood liver disease. The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is increased in individuals with AATD.\\nThe diagnosis of AATD relies on demonstration of low serum concentration of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) and either detection of a functionally deficient AAT protein variant by protease inhibitor (PI) typing or detection of biallelic pathogenic variants in \\nAATD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. When both parents are heterozygotes (e.g., PI*MZ), each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected (PI*ZZ), a 50% chance of being a carrier (PI*MZ), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier (PI*MM). In the uncommon instance in which one parent is homozygous (PI*ZZ) and one parent is heterozygous (PI*MZ), the risk to each sib of being homozygous (PI*ZZ) is 50%. Unless an individual with AATD has children with a reproductive partner who is affected or a carrier, his/her offspring will be obligate heterozygotes (carriers) for the pathogenic variant. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible once the pathogenic ',\n 'Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is characterized by variable liver, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle involvement. GSD IIIa is the most common subtype, present in about 85% of affected individuals; it manifests with liver and muscle involvement. GSD IIIb, with liver involvement only, comprises about 15% of all GSD III. In infancy and early childhood, liver involvement presents as ketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, hyperlipidemia, and elevated hepatic transaminases. In adolescence and adulthood, liver disease becomes less prominent. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy develops in the majority of those with GSD IIIa, usually during childhood. Its clinical significance ranges from asymptomatic in the majority to severe cardiac dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and (rarely) sudden death. Skeletal myopathy manifesting as weakness is not usually evident in childhood, but slowly progresses, typically becoming prominent in the third to fourth decade.\\nHepatomegaly, ketotic hypoglycemia with fasting, and elevated serum concentrations of transaminases and CK are the hallmarks of GSD III. The serum CK may not be elevated at the time of the diagnostic work up, but the absence of lactic acidosis and markedly elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations may provide clues to the diagnosis. Measurement of fasting serum concentration of glucose after glucagon administration can be used to support the diagnosis; glucagon administration should not cause the glucose concentration to rise following a prolonged fast, but should do so after a fast of two hours or less. The diagnosis is established by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in \\nGSD III is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier.

Rarely it may occur in patients with autoimmune markers but no definable autoimmune disease (Primary-AIMF). We report the cases of two young women with SLE-associated AIMF (SLE-AIMF). The first patient was a young woman who had pancytopenia, massive splenomegaly and reticulin fibrosis in the marrow biopsy. The pancytopenia and splenomegaly resolved completely within weeks of treatment with corticosteroids. Repeat marrow biopsy showed marked regression of marrow fibrosis. The second patient was a young woman with fever, anasarca, bicytopenia and reticulin fibrosis in the marrow biopsy. Steroid therapy resulted in rapid clinical improvement and resolution of pancytopenia. A review of the literature revealed a total of 30 patients with SLE-AIMF reported to-date. Patients with SLE-AIMF are young women with SLE and blood cytopenia who are found to have increased bone marrow reticulin on marrow biopsy. Steroid therapy results in rapid hematological recovery and regression of marrow fibrosis. Whether AIMF is one of several hematological complications of SLE, or represents a unique and distinct subset of patients with SLE in not clear.

In B-cell malignancies, its role was well explored; its expression was shown to be connected with disease prognosis in certain B-non Hodgkin lymphomas. In this study, 16 bone marrow trephine samples from patients with no hematopoietic malignancies and 10 samples from peripheral blood of healthy individuals were immunostained with anti-FOXP1 antibody. Positive cells in bone marrows were not only lymphocytes, but also cells that are immunohistochemically positive for glycophorin C or myeloperoxidase. Peripheral blood samples showed no other positive cells, but small round lymphocytes. Additionally 60 samples from patients with myeloid lineage neoplasms were analyzed. 25 samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and 35 patients with myeloproliferative disease (MPD) were double immunostained with anti-FOXP1/anti-glycophorin C and anti-FOXP1/anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies. FOXP1 was found to be expressed in 22 cases of MDS and in none of MPD cases. Its expression in MDS was observed mostly in myeloperoxidase positive cells in contrast to gylcophorin C positive cells. Only two cases revealed both myeloperoxidase positive cells and gylcophorin C positive cells expressing FOXP1 transcription factor. Our results show that FOXP1 is present in normal cells of erythroid and myeloid linages and thus suggest its possible role in development of all hematopoetic cells as well as possible involvement in neoplasm development of myeloid disorders.',\n 'Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) occurs in various bone marrow disorders and is most commonly seen in thalassemia and myelofibrosis. Here, we report a patient with beta-thalassemia and nasopharyngeal carcinoma having intrathoracic EMH. Our patient is a 42-year-old man who complained of chest discomfort for a month. He was confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T3N2M0) by histopathology and received chemoradiotherapy 4 months ago. The patient had a long history of beta-thalassemia and a splenectomy due to splenomegaly at 12 years of age. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed multiple soft tissue masses in bilateral thoracic cavities. 18F-FDG-PET showed no obvious increase of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake by the lesions, with an SUVmax value of approximately 2.19. These lesions were considered EMH. The patient had been followed up for more than 1 year, and there were no changes of the lesions in the thoracic cavities. ',\n 'The classical myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are a group of clonal diseases comprising essential thrombocythaemia (ET), polycythaemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PMF is the rarest disease sub type and has been challenging to address due to the lack of a specific genetic marker, inadequate risk identification models and a highly variable clinical course. Continuous efforts have over time, seen the inclusion of cytogenetic information in prognostic scoring models that have resulted in improved risk stratification models providing further rationale for therapeutic management. Technological advances using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays increased the detection of known and novel MPN related changes and variant detection by massively parallel sequencing provided a large scale screening tool for the multitude of somatic gene mutations that have more recently been described in MPN. Some of these mutations show an association with specific cytogenetic changes or phenotypes. While PMF occurs mainly in adults, it has also been described in paediatric cases and shows distinct histopathological, genetic and clinical features in comparison. This review provides an overview of the genomics landscape of PMF and current developments in MPN therapy. ',\n 'Chromosomal abnormalities at 14q11, which encodes the T-cell receptor α and δ chain genes, are generally specific for T-cell malignancies, and are rarely reported in other malignancies. We report a novel t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) in a patient with myelofibrosis (MF) following polycythemia vera (PV). This 55-year-old male developed post-PV MF 12 years after the initial diagnosis of PV. He had a normal karyotype at polycythemic disease stage, t(11;14)(p13;q11.2) was newly detected at the time of fibrotic transformation. Therefore, it is likely that this clonal chromosomal abnormality was associated with progression of disease. ',\n 'The gain-of-function mutation JAK2V617F is frequently found in Philadelphia-chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) patients. However, the tumorigenic properties of JAK2V617F have mostly been characterized in in vivo and in vitro murine models due to the lack of appropriate human cell lines.\\nUsing the multipotent hematologic cell line UT-7/GM, we established D9, a novel human cell line that expresses JAK2V617F upon tetracycline addition. We assessed cellular differentiation in UT-7/GM cells when JAK2V617F was induced, and we used microarrays to analyze changes in mRNA expression caused by JAK2V617F.\\nUsing the human D9 cell line, we demonstrated that the induction of JAK2V617F leads to cytokine-independent cell growth with increased STAT activation and erythroid differentiation, mimicking the characteristics observed in polycythemia vera, making it a suitable in vitro model for studying this disorder. Interestingly, JAK2V617F-dependent erythroid cell differentiation was blocked when GM-CSF was added to the culture, suggesting that the GM-CSF pathway antagonizes JAK2V617F-induced erythroid cell differentiation. Our microarray analysis identified several genes involved in inflammasome activation, such as AIM2, IL1B, and CASP1, which were significantly up-regulated in JAK2V617F-induced cells.\\nThe observed inflammasome activation following JAK2V617F induction is consistent with a recent report demonstrating the involvement of IL1B in myelofibrosis development in a JAK2V617F model mouse. These results indicate that the D9 cell line should be useful for characterizing the signaling pathways downstream of JAK2V617F, allowing for the identification of effector molecules that contribute to the development of MPN.',\n 'Tuberculosis is an opportunistic infection with protean clinical manifestations. We describe a case of Ruxolitinib induced miliary tuberculosis presenting as a neck lump. A 78-year-old female presented with a two-month history of right-sided neck lump associated with fever, night sweats, and significant weight loss. She had a past medical history that included myelofibrosis, being treated with Ruxolitinib. Examination demonstrated 4 × 4\\u2009cm right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. A chest radiograph showed extensive shadowing in both lungs. CT scan demonstrated perilymphatic nodes in addition to the cervical mass. An ultrasound-guided biopsy of a cervical lymph node demonstrated confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. It was hypothesized that use of Ruxolitinib through its selective inhibition of Janus-activated kinases 1 and 2 resulted in immunosuppression and miliary tuberculosis in this patient. The medication was stopped and a 12-month regime of antituberculosis therapy commenced. She remained well at one-year follow-up with resolution of lung involvement. Clinicians should consider tuberculosis as a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with a neck lump, particularly in those taking immunosuppressant medication such as Ruxolitinib. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to promptly treat the tuberculosis and consider discontinuation of Ruxolitinib.

Patients with and without concomitant avWS were compared in terms of their demographic characteristics, present and past medical histories and laboratory parameters.\\nConcomitant avWS was found in 5 patients (15.6%). In 1/5 patients with avWS and in 8/27 persons without this bleeding disorder, myelofibrosis developed secondarily to polycythemia vera (n = 7) or essential thrombocytopenia (n = 2). As many as 4/5 individuals with avWS presented with clinical evidence of a bleeding disorder. The subjects with avWS differed from the remaining patients with myelofibrosis in terms of significantly lower activity of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and lower vWF to vWF antigen ratio.\\nAll patients with myelofibrosis should be routinely evaluated for avWS with the panel of specific tests. Further, avWS should be the primary suspicion in each patient with myelofibrosis in whom clinical evidence of a bleeding disorder has emerged.',\n 'Primary idiopathic myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by extramedullary hematopoiesis and marrow fibrosis. It is an uncommon hematopoietic malignancy which primarily affects elderly individuals. The rational of this study was to determine its clinico-epidemiological profile along with risk stratification in Pakistani patients.\\nIn this retrospective cross sectional study, 20 patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis were enrolled from January 2011 to December 2014.

Overall only 10% of patients were asymptomatic and the remainder presented with constitutional symptoms. In symptomatic patients, major complaints were weakness (80%), weight loss (75%), abdominal discomfort (60%), night sweats (13%), pruritus (5%) and cardiovascular accidents (5%).

Thyroid EMH is usually an incidental finding, most likely related to mature osseous metaplasia. An occasional association with hematologic disease has been reported, however. To date, there does not appear to be any association with thyroid malignancy and surgery is typically not indicated. Therefore, recognition at the time of FNA is essential.',\n 'Primary myelofibrosis, the most aggressive of the classic Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), is a clonal disorder characterized by often debilitating constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis and resultant cytopenias, extramedullary hematopoiesis, risk of leukemic transformation, and shortened survival. Post-polycythemia vera and post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis represent similar entities, although some differences are being recognized. Attempts to classify patients with myelofibrosis into prognostic categories have been made since the late 1980s, and these scoring systems continue to evolve as new information becomes available. Over the last decade, the molecular pathogenesis of MPNs has been elucidated considerably, and the Janus kinase (JAK) 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is the first drug specifically approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat patients with intermediate-risk and high-risk myelofibrosis. This article reviews the evolution of prognostic criteria in myelofibrosis, emphasizing the major systems widely in use today, as well as recently described, novel systems that incorporate emerging data regarding somatic mutations. Risk factors for thrombosis and conversion to MPN blast phase also are discussed. Finally, the practical usefulness of the current prognostic classification systems in terms of clinical decision making is discussed, particularly within the context of some of their inherent weaknesses.

',\n 'Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is currently diagnosed either by the British Committee of Standards in Haematology (BCSH) criteria that are predominantly based on exclusion and not necessarily on bone marrow (BM) morphology, or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria that require BM examination as essential criterion. We studied the morphological and clinical features in patients diagnosed according either to the BCSH (n=238) or the WHO guidelines (n=232). The BCSH-defined ET cohort was re-evaluated by applying the WHO classification. At presentation, patients of the BCSH group showed significantly higher values of serum lactate dehydrogenase and had palpable splenomegaly more frequently. Following the WHO criteria, the re-evaluation of the BCSH-diagnosed ET cohort displayed a heterogeneous population with 141 (59.2%) ET, 77 (32.4%) prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (prePMF), 16 (6.7%) polycythemia vera and 4 (1.7%) primary myelofibrosis. Contrasting WHO-confirmed ET, the BCSH cohort revealed a significant worsening of fibrosis-free survival and prognosis. As demonstrated by the clinical data and different outcomes between WHO-diagnosed ET and prePMF, these adverse features were generated by the inadvertent inclusion of prePMF to the BCSH group. Taken together, the diagnosis of ET without a scrutinized examination of BM biopsy specimens will generate a heterogeneous cohort of patients impairing an appropriate clinical management.',\n None,\n 'The only curative therapy for primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, although we know that patients can benefit from ASCT, we do not know the extent of the changes of the expression profile of cytokines and matrix modulation factors. In this first systematic analysis, we evaluated the expression profile of 103 factors before and after transplantation to identify potential biomarkers. The expression of fibrosis-, inflammation-, and angiogenesis-associated genes was analyzed in a total of 52 bone marrow biopsies: PMF patients (n\\xa0=\\xa014) before and after ASCT and, for control purposes, post-ASCT multiple myeloma patients (n\\xa0=\\xa014) and non-neoplastic hematopoiesis (n\\xa0=\\xa010). In post-ASCT PMF cases, decreased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) and platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFA) correlated with bone marrow remodeling and hematological remission. Expression of several other matrix factors remained at high levels and may contribute to post-ASCT remodeling. This is the first systematic analysis of cytokine expression in post-ASCT PMF bone marrow that shows that normalization of bone marrow microenvironment is paralleled by decreased expression of TIMP and PDGFA. ',\n 'Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib is associated with transient and usually mild elevations in serum aminotransferase during therapy, but has not been linked to cases of clinically apparent idiosyncratic acute liver injury but has been shown to be a cause of reactivation of hepatitis B.',\n 'This article explores the public dying of journalist, writer, provocateur, public intellectual, and renowned atheist, Christopher Hitchens. It does so primarily through an analysis of television interviews given by Hitchens following his diagnosis with esophageal cancer in June 2010. Four key themes are identified as emerging from analysis of the interviews: (a) Hitchens\\' explicit sense of mission in challenging myths and superstitions surrounding cancer, dying, and death; (b) the personal experience of terminal illness and dying and the particular way (or style of dying) by which it is approached; (c) issues of regret and a life well lived; and (d) questions surrounding religion, the afterlife, and possibility of deathbed conversion. In light of the claim that ours is a culture in search of an ars moriendi, the article examines what we can learn from Hitchens\\' auto/pathographic interviews (and writings) and the extent to which this rational-humanist, atheistic, and stoical style of dying provides a useable \"template\" for others nearing the end of life.',\n 'This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and hospitalization cost between early enteral nutrition (EEN) and parenteral nutrition (PN) after resection of esophageal cancer. A total of 79 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgical treatment in our hospital from July 2010 to July 2013 were enrolled in this study. They were divided into EEN group (',\n \"Over the last decade, there has been a shift towards endoscopic treatment of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and T1 stage adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's oesophagus. Although short-term outcomes are promising, longer-term outcomes remain uncertain and the role of these therapies versus surgery is debated, with surgical mortality rates assumed. However, few studies have specifically determined the outcome for oesophagectomy in the subgroup with HGD or T1 adenocarcinoma. To determine this, we evaluated experience with oesophagectomy for HGD and T1 adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus.\\nData were analysed from a prospective audit database for oesophagectomy performed at two public and four associated private hospitals in Adelaide, South Australia. Patients with HGD, T1a and T1b adenocarcinoma who underwent oesophagectomy from 20\\u2009February 1998 to 17\\u2009February 2012 were identified, and their perioperative, post-operative and survival outcomes were determined.\\nFrom 452 oesophagectomy procedures, 63 (13.9%) individuals who underwent surgery for HGD or T1 adenocarcinoma were identified; HGD - 19 (30.1%), T1a - 18 (28.5 %), T1b - 26 (41.3%). Major complications occurred in eight (12.7%) patients including one (1.6%) death following surgery. Five-year survival for HGD and T1a cancers using Kaplan-Meier analysis was not significantly different from a matched general population without cancer.\\nOesophagectomy for HGD and T1 stage adenocarcinoma in Barrett's oesophagus is associated with favourable outcomes. Outcomes following endoscopic treatments should be benchmarked against these outcomes, not those following oesophagectomy for advanced cancer.\",\n 'Gastric pull-up (GPU) is the most common procedure for restoring the continuity of the alimentary tract. Yet, complications because of anastomotic problems are reported to be as high as 25% after this procedure. Managing the neck with anastomotic leakage or stricture following failed GPU and/or radiotherapy is formidable. We report our method, basic algorithm and results with the complicated GPU procedure management with intestinal transfers .\\nNineteen cases referred to our department with complicated esophageal reconstruction following GPU procedure were included in this report. Of the19 patients, 18 had undergone GPU procedure for reconstruction after cancer resection (mean age 55 years) and one for idiopathic esophagitis (mean age 45years). Fifteen patients presented with severe stricture formation and 4 patients with leakage from the anastomotic site. Average time between the GPU and salvage procedures was 7.3 months for patients with stricture formation and 15.5 days for patients with leakage. Pedicled colon interposition (n\\u2009=\\u20098) was used when the upper end of the gastric tube was located below the sternoclavicular junction. A free jejunal flap (n\\u2009=\\u200911) was utilized when defects were located at the neck (above the sternoclavicular junction).\\nIn all patients salvage procedures with intestinal flap transfer were successful with complete flap survival. Post-operative period was uneventful except of two patients with pedicled colon interposition who presented minor leakage post-operatively (10.5%). This was treated with conservative means, leading to spontaneous healing. The average follow-up for the patients with tumor resection was 11.8 months (range: 6 to 30) after the salvage procedure. All patients resumed smooth oral intake eventually. There were 16 patients who could feed with solid diet, whereas three patients were able to tolerate only soft diet.\\nIntestinal tissues can be safely and successfully transferred as salvage procedures, with meticulous technique, careful patient selection and individual flap design. While gastric pull-up remains a good procedure for esophageal reconstruction, the methods described in this report are useful as back-up armaments in complicated cases. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Microsurgery 36:567-572, 2016.',\n 'Aberrant methylation of DNA is a common event in the development of cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the human esophagus. In the present study, we determined: (a) whether aberrant DNA methylation also occurs in the development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced tumorigenesis in the rat esophagus, a model of human esophageal SCC; and (b) if so, whether dietary black raspberries (BRBs) are capable of preventing this aberrant DNA methylation. A diet containing 5% BRBs inhibited the development of NMBA-induced tumors in the rat esophagus. This inhibition was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b, in both dysplastic lesions and in papillomas of the esophagus. In addition, promoter methylation of Sfrp4, a WNT pathway antagonist, was significantly reduced by the berry diet, and this was associated with decreased nuclear localization of β-CATENIN and reduced expression of c-MYC protein in NMBA-treated esophagi. Decreased promoter methylation of Sfrp4 correlated with decreased expression of Dmnt3b and, ultimately, with increased Sfrp4 mRNA expression. This suggests that epigenetic alterations in NMBA-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis recapitulate epigenetic events in human esophageal SCC, and that BRBs could be useful in preventing the aberrant DNA methylation involved in the development of human esophageal SCC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.',\n 'Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is characterized by rapidly increasing incidence and mortality rates and poor survival. Efficacious preventive and treatment options are urgently needed. An increasing number of pharmacologic agents targeting cancer cell death via autophagy mechanisms are being evaluated in hopes of circumventing apoptotic and therapeutic resistance. We report for the first time, loss of Beclin-1, a key mediator of autophagy, was significantly linked to prognostic factors in EAC. Specifically, Beclin-1 expression loss occurred in 49.0% of EAC patients versus 4.8% of controls. There was a significant inverse correlation between loss of Beclin-1 with histologic grade and tumor stage supporting a tumor suppressive role for Beclin-1. Autophagy modulation linked to cell death was examined in EAC cell lines following treatment with a proanthocyanidin-rich cranberry extract, C-PAC, and the commonly used autophagy inducer, rapamycin. C-PAC induced Beclin-1-independent autophagy in EAC cells characterized by reduced phosphorylation at serine 15 and 93, and significant cell death induction. In contrast, rapamycin-induced autophagy resulted in concomitant, increases in total Beclin-1 levels as well as Beclin-1-phosphorylation in a cell line specific manner, leading to long-term cell survival. Furthermore, autophagic LC3-II was induced by C-PAC following siRNA suppression of Beclin-1 in EAC cells. Together these data support a prognostic role of Beclin-1 in EAC with evidence that Beclin-dependent autophagy induction is agent specific. Future studies are necessary to fully interrogate the role autophagy plays in the progression of normal tissue to EAC and how specific agents targeting autophagic mechanisms can be efficaciously applied for cancer prevention or treatment. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.',\n 'Primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus (PMME) is a very rare disease with poor prognosis.

Here, we present the endoscopic features and management of PMME case.',\n 'Clinical pathways reduce hospitalization and costs in colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We describe creating an esophagectomy pathway and analyze its implementation and effects.\\nWe documented the process of developing an esophagectomy clinical pathway. We performed a retrospective review of prospectively collected data on 12 patients before pathway implementation and 12 patients after.\\nPathway Implementation: more patients were presented at tumor board (9 pathway vs. 2 pre-pathway; p=0.012) and chose their postoperative care facility before surgery (8 vs. 0; p=0.0013) OUTCOMES: There were no changes in mortality (0 vs. 0), major complications (5 vs. 5), hospitalization (median 9.5 vs. 12 days; p=0.82), and total charges ($ 98,395 vs. $ 96,946; p=0.96). Pathway patients lost significantly less weight preoperatively (2.3% vs. 7.6%; p=0.01) and perioperatively (6.3% vs. 12%; p=0.02).\\nThis is the first study to report the process of designing and implementing an esophagectomy pathway. While there was no significant decrease in mortality, complications, hospitalization, or charges, our pathway significantly decreased pre- and perioperative weight loss, which we attribute to coordinated patient education and care.',\n 'The objective include thoracoscopic esophagectomy for the deep-seated (left-sided) esophagus has several technical difficulties, which may affects the intraoperative or postoperative outcomes. However, no previous studies have focused on the correlation between the position of the esophagus and short-term outcome after thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Of 470 esophagectomies between April 2005 and April 2015 in Kumamoto University Hospital, 112 patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer were examined. The position of the esophagus was divided into 2 types: deep-seated esophagus or another type based on computed tomographic images in the supine position. In results, the deep-seated esophagus was associated with a longer operation time in the thorax and high incidence of severe morbidity of Clavien-Dindo classification ≥IIIb, pneumonia, and any pulmonary morbidity. The deep-seated esophagus was also an independent risk factor for severe morbidity (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.37, 95% CI: 1.307-22.03; P = 0.020), pneumonia (HR = 9.23, 95% CI: 2.150-39.60; P = 0.003), and any pulmonary morbidity (HR = 10.3, 95% CI: 2.714-38.78; P < 0.001). In conclusion, the position of the esophagus had a strong influence on the difficulty of thoracoscopic esophagectomy and the incidence of postoperative morbidities. Surgeons would be well advised to keep a careful watch perioperatively for patients with a deep-seated esophagus. ',\n 'Minimally invasive esophagectomy with intrathoracic dissection and anastomosis is increasingly performed. Our objectives are to report our operative technique, early results and lessons learned. This is a retrospective review of 85 consecutive patients who were scheduled for minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (laparoscopic or robotic abdominal and robotic chest) for esophageal cancer. Between 4/2011 and 3/2015, 85 (74 men, median age: 63) patients underwent robotic Ivor Lewis esophageal resection. In all, 64 patients (75%) had preoperative chemoradiotherapy, 99% had esophageal cancer, and 99% had an R0 resection. There were no abdominal or thoracic conversions for bleeding. There was 1 abdominal conversion for the inability to completely staple the gastric conduit. The mean operative time was 6 hours, median blood loss was 35ml (no intraoperative transfusions), median number of resected lymph nodes was 22, and median length of stay was 8 days. Conduit complications (anastomotic leak or conduit ischemia) occurred in 6 patients. The 30 and 90-day mortality were 3/85 (3.5%) and 9/85 (10.6%), respectively. Initial poor results led to protocol changes via root cause analysis: longer rehabilitation before surgery, liver biopsy in patients with history of suspected cirrhosis, and refinements to conduit preparation and anastomotic technique. Robotic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for cancer provides an R0 resection with excellent lymph node resection. Our preferred port placement and operative techniques are described. Disappointingly high thoracic conduit problems and 30 and 90-day mortality led to lessons learned and implementation of change which are shared. ',\n 'We aimed to investigate the SUVmax of primary tumor and metastatic lymph node in predicting survival in patients with esophageal cancer.\\nWe retrospectively analyzed patients with esophageal cancer between 2009 and 2011 who had FDG positron-emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). All patients were followed-up to 2013. Clinical staging, SUVmax of primary tumor and metastatic lymph node were evaluated.\\nOne hundred seven patients were included in the study. All patients were followed-up between 2 and 49 months. The mean SUVmax of primary tumor and metastatic lymph node were 19.3±8.8 and 10.4±9.1, respectively. Metastatic lymph node SUVmax had an effect in predicting survival whereas primary tumor SUVmax did not have an effect (p=0.014 and p=0.262, respectively). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that clinical stage of the disease was the only independent factor predicting survival (p=0.001).\\nAmong patients with esophageal cancer, the value of primary tumor SUVmax did not have an effect on survival. Clinical stage assessed with FDG PET/CT imaging was found to predict survival in esophageal carcinoma. Additionally, lymph node SUVmax was identified as a new parameter in predicting survival in the present study.\\nAmaç: Çalışmamızda özofagus kanserli hastalarda primer tümör SUDmax ve metastatik lenf nodu SUDmax’ın sağ kalım üzerine olan etkisini araştırmayı amaçladık. Yöntem: 2009 ve 2011 yılları arasında evreleme amacıyla FDG pozitron emisyon tomografisi (PET)/bilgisayarlı tomografi (BT) yapılan özofagus kanseri tanılı hastalar retrospektif olarak incelendi. Tüm hastalar Eylül 2013 yılına kadar takip edildi. Histopatoloji, lokalizasyon, klinik evre, primer tümör ve metatastatik SUVmax kaydedildi. Tanımlanan parametreler arasındaki ilişkiler ve sağ kalım univaryant ve multivaryant Cox regresyon analizi ile değerlendirildi. Bulgular: Çalışmaya 107 hasta dahil edildi. Hastaların hepsi 2-49 ay arasında takip edildi. Primer tümör ve metastatik lenf nodu ortalama SUDmax sırasıyla 19,3±8,8 ve 10,4±9,1 olarak hesaplandı.

Eighty-eight cancer tissues, 35 paraneoplastic atypical hyperplasia tissues (PAHTs), and 30 relative normal esophageal tissues (RNETs) were collected and tested for expression of PD-1 by immunohistochemistry assay. The PD-1 expression and clinical characteristics of the ESCC patients were evaluated. The prognosis of the ESCC patients was compared between the PD-1 positive and negative patients.\\nThe PD-1 positive rate was 51.2% (45/88), 22.9% (8/35), and 6.7% (2/30) for the cancer tissue, PAHT, and RNET, respectively, with statistical difference (P < 0.05); The PD-1 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05) and pathology grade (P < 0.05). The median overall survival was 29.8 months and 32.1 months for the PD-1 positive and negative groups without statistical difference (hazard ratio = 1.00, 95% confidence interval = 0.58-1.71, P < 0.05).\\nPD-1 may play a key role in the process of carcinogenesis of ESCC but not associated with prognosis and overall survival.',\n 'The function of long noncoding RNA SPRY4-IT1 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) has been showed in the former studies. The purpose of this study was to further analyze the underlined mechanisms responsible for its role in ESCC cells.\\nQuantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was firstly used to measure the expression of SPRY4-IT1 in 50 ESCC patients of different clinical stages. Loss of function approach was then applied to confirm the biological function, especially cell viabilities in cultured ESCC cells, by cell counting kit-8 and clonogenic assay. We further used western blot to reveal the activation of zinc finger 703 (ZNF703) by SPRY4-IT1.\\nWe validated that SPRY4-IT1 was upregulated in ESCC tissues of advanced clinical stages. In vitro function assays demonstrated that SPRY4-IT1 cause promotion of cell viability in ESCC cells.

Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and real-time endobronchial ultrasounds transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are accurate, minimally invasive and safe diagnostic techniques for mediastinal staging. Because of the different accessibility to the mediastinum, they are considered complementary and their combination increases the diagnostic yield as compared with the either alone. Recent studies have shown that endosonography represents the best initial test for invasive mediastinal evaluation in NSCLC. Endoscopic ultrasound (with bronchoscope)-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) is a recently introduced procedure consisting of a transesophageal needle aspiration using an ultrasound bronchoscope. It allows to perform both transbronchial and transesophageal needle sampling with the same instrument, in the same session and by one operator only, thus maximizing time and costs savings. In a recent study Oki et al. randomized 110 patients with hilar/mediastinal adenopathies or lung abnormalities adjoining both the esophagus and the bronchi, to undergo EBUS-TBNA or EUS-FNA performed by pulmonologists with an echobronchoscope. The Authors demonstrated that both procedures provide a high diagnostic yield, without any difference in the number of adverse events and a good comparable tolerance. Nevertheless, the transesophageal approach guaranteed a significantly lower dose of anesthetics and sedatives, a shorter procedural time, fewer oxygen desaturations, a significantly lower cough score and a higher operator satisfaction. In this review our aim was to discuss the findings by Oki et al. in the context of medical literature, highlighting the importance of the EUS-B needle aspiration technique in diagnosing mediastinal and lung lesions, when EBUS-TBNA is deemed less suitable. Finally, we pointed out the importance of interventional pulmonologists being trained to perform mediastinal sampling by the esophageal route, to choose the best solution in every technical and clinical occurence. ',\n \"The risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in non-dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (NDBE) is considered to be approximately 0.3% per year or even lower, according to population-based studies. Data from countries with low EAC incidence are scarce. Our principal aim was to determine the incidence of high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and EAC in NDBE. Our secondary aims were to identify the predictors of progression and to calculate the incidence of HGD/EAC, by using the calculation method for surveillance time in population-based studies.\\nA cohort of NDBE patients was prospectively followed up. Cases of HGD and EAC (study end points) diagnosed during the first year of follow-up were considered as prevalent. Only cases with an endoscopic surveillance time\\u2009>\\u20091 year were included in our analysis.\\nWe enrolled 331 patients (251 men) in the surveillance program. Their median age was 59 years (interquartile range (IQR): 47-67 years). Their median NDBE length was 3\\u2009cm (IQR: 2-4\\u2009cm). Of these patients, 80 died during the follow-up (one from EAC) and two were lost to follow-up. After 2284 patient-years of endoscopic follow-up (median surveillance time, 5 years (IQR: 2-10 years)), we found that five cases of HGD and two cases of EAC were diagnosed. The incidence of HGD/EAC was 3.1 cases per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 1.3-6.0) and that of EAC was 0.9 (95% CI: 0.2-2.9). The incidence of HGD/EAC in short segments (≤ 3\\u2009cm) was 0.7 cases per 1000 patient-years (95% CI: 0.3-3.4). The sole variable that we found associated with progression was NDBE length. If the total surveillance time was considered (3537 patient-years), the incidence of HGD and EAC was only slight lower.\\nThe incidence of HGD and EAC was very low in NDBE. Therefore, current surveillance guidelines must be reassessed, at least for short-segment BE.\",\n 'To analyze the correlation between the concentration of plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) of patients with lung cancer or esophageal cancer and clinical features, and to assess the coincidence rate of the EGFR/KRAS mutations between the cfDNA and tumor tissue DNA.\\nA total of 30 cases lung cancer and esophageal cancer (including 15 lung cancer, 15 esophageal cancer) were enrolled in this study. The tumor tissue and plasma sample of patients were collected. The tumor tissue DNA and plasma cfDNA were extracted. The EGFR/KRAS mutations of the tumor tissue DNA and plasma cfDNA were detected by fluorescence PCR.\\nThe concentration of cfDNA of patients with lung cancer (5.0 ± 1.4) μg/L and esophageal cancer (7.0 ± 0.8) μg/L were positively correlated with tumor size (r = 0.574, P = 0.01). There was no significant correlation between the concentration of cfDNA and TNM stage of tumor, gender, and age of patients. There was no EGFR/KRAS gene mutations in tumor tissue DNA and plasma cfDNA of esophageal cancer. A total of 6 tumor tissue samples of lung cancer patients were detected EGFR mutation, and 1 tumor tissue sample was detected KRAS mutation. Meanwhile, 4 plasma cfDNA samples of lung cancer patients were detected EGFR mutation, and 1 plasma cfDNA sample was detected KRAS mutation.\\nThe concentration of cfDNA of patients with lung cancer and esophageal cancer was positively correlated with tumor burden.

Cancer incidence and mortality rates for some cancers in the USA and European countries have steadily decreased over the last decades, whereas the incidence and mortality of certain cancers in China have been increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China have been accompanied by incredible changes in lifestyle and environment combined with an aging population. Mortality caused by lung, colorectal and breast cancers has been steadily increasing, whereas cancer mortality from gastric, esophageal and cervical tumors has tended to decrease. Similar to what has occurred in the United States, unhealthy lifestyles in China, including heavy smoking and poor diet combined with pollution, have contributed to increased cancer risk. China is facing many challenges in cancer treatment and prevention for the general population. The major areas that need to be addressed in the control of cancer in China include cancers associated with environmental pollution, tobacco use, occupational carcinogens, infection, excessive alcohol consumption, dietary deficiencies and obesity. In this perspective, we review the problems in each area and suggest ideas for future directions in cancer research and strategies and actions to reduce the incidence of cancer in China.',\n \"Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (NCCRT) is often considered for locally-advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (LA-ESCC) patients; however, no data regarding the cost-effectiveness of this treatment is available. Our study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NCCRT versus esophagectomy for LA-ESCC at population level.\\nWe identified LA-ESCC patients diagnosed within 2008-2009 and treated with either NCCRT or esophagectomy through the Taiwan Cancer Registry. We included potential confounding covariables (age, gender, residency, comorbidity, social-economic status, disease stage, treating hospital level and surgeon's experience, and the use of endoscopic ultrasound before treatment) and used propensity score (PS) to construct a 1:1 population. The duration of interest was three years within the date of diagnosis. Effectiveness was measured as overall survival. We took the payer's perspective and converted the cost to 2014 United States dollars (USD). In sensitivity analysis, we evaluated the potential impact of an unmeasured confounder on the statistical significance of incremental net benefit at suggested willingness-to-pay.\\nOur study population constituted 150 PS matched subjects. The mean cost (2014 USD) and survival (year) were higher for NCCRT compared with esophagectomy (US$91,460 vs. $75,836 for cost; 2.2 vs. 1.8 for survival) with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$39,060/life-year.\\nWhen compared to esophagectomy, NCCRT is likely to improve survival and is probably more cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness results should be interpreted with caution given our results were sensitive to potential unmeasured confounder(s) in sensitivity analysis.\",\n 'Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a risk factor for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as well as esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to investigate whether HPV infection underlies the field cancerization phenomenon over upper aerodigestive tract to develop synchronous multiple cancers.\\nA case control study.\\nThe presence and subtype of HPV-DNA sequence in cancers were examined by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing in a prospective cohort with 100 HNSCCs, 50 of which had synchronous ESCCs. The clinicopathologic characteristics were further analyzed according to the presence of HPV.\\nTwelve patients were HPV-positive, of which 11 were positive for HPV-16. The prevalence of HPV infection were not different between the synchronous and HNSCC alone groups (P = 0.357). Testing for HPV in paired HNSCC and ESCC tissues from the same patient revealed that none were concomitantly HPV-positive. Multivariate logistic regression showed drinking alcohol (odds ratio [OR], 18.75; P = 0.030), alcohol flushing (OR, 2.53; P = 0.041), and body mass index (OR, 0.77; P = 0.001) but not HPV infection were independent risk factors for synchronous phenotype. The patients with synchronous ESCCs had significantly poorer survival than those with HNSCC alone (5-year overall survival: 30% vs. 70%; log-rank P < 0.001). However, patients with HPV-positive HNSCC tend to have favorable outcome than those with HPV-negative HNSCC.\\nHPV infection plays little role in field cancerization phenomenon to initiate synchronous SCC.

Routine endoscopic examination of the esophagus should be recommended for patients with risk factors identified.\\nNA. Laryngoscope, 126:1097-1102, 2016.',\n \"Gastric subepithelial tumors represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, given their histologic heterogeneity and potential malignant behavior.\\nThe objective of this article is to evaluate the interest, efficiency and safety of endoscopic resection for subepithelial gastric lesions of size <20\\u2009mm.\\nWe conducted a single-center retrospective study in a tertiary care center.\\nA total of 33 lesions (10 malignant/23 benign lesions) were studied. Mean histological size was 14.5\\u2009mm. Nine EMR, 18 ESD and six hybrid resections were performed. A total of 93.9% lesions were resected in one piece. At six months' follow-up, complete and definitive resection was obtained in 96.7% of cases. A vertical resection was insufficient in four cases. One GIST needed a complementary surgical resection, one neuroendocrine tumor was successfully treated by a new ESD session and two pancreatic rests were not additionally treated given the benign character and the absence of residual tissue in endoscopic control after six months. There was only one severe adverse event (2.9%); one pneumoperitoneum with ESD, three bleeding with one ESD and two EMR, always treated conservatively or endoscopically.\\nEndoscopic resection is safe and should be the procedure of choice for both diagnosis and definitive resection of subepithelial gastric lesions of size under 20\\u2009mm.\",\n 'Patients with stage IIIA-ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement (N2) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represent a heterogeneous group with different clinical presentation. The aim of this study was to analyze a series of patients with \"potentially resectable\" stage IIIA-pathologically proven N2 (pN2) NSCLC undergoing induction chemotherapy followed by surgery to evaluate their long-term outcomes and to identify prognostic factors. Out of 287 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy for NSCLC with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement pathologically proven, we retrospectively evaluated 141 (49%) patients with no clinical evidence of progression after induction chemotherapy and candidates for surgery. Most of them (73%) underwent at least 3 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to plot survival and the log-rank test to assess the survival difference between groups. Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 15 (10.6%) patients underwent explorative thoracotomy; 126 patients underwent surgical anatomical resection after a median 27 days (range: 21-30) from the last cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 113 (89.7%) patients had a radical resection. A total of 22 (17.5%) patients had a complete pathologic lymph node downstaging (pN0), and 8 (6.3%) patients had a complete pathological response (pT0N0). The median overall survival was 24 months, with a 5-year overall survival of 30%. At multivariable analysis, downstaging and number of cycles of chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors (P = 0.006); downstaging benefit was mostly because of complete pathological response (hazards ratio = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07-0.76). In conclusion, more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and pathological downstaging could significantly improve 5-year survival in selected patients with \"potentially resectable\" pathologically proven N2 disease.',\n 'Gefitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor used in the therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.

The enzymes create and then repair single stranded nicks in cellular DNA. The nicks allow for the untangling and relaxation of supercoiled double stranded DNA, so that replication can proceed. Once the DNA torsional strain has been relieved, the topoisomerase reseals the relaxed double helix. Topoisomerase activity is particularly increased in rapidly dividing and in cancer cells. It represents an appropriate, but nonselective target for anticancer therapy. Topoisomerase inhibitors in current use in the United States include irinotecan and topotecan, inhibitors of topoisomerase I, and etoposide and teniposide, inhibitors of topoisomerase II. All four agents are semisynthetic analogues of natural toxins that were initially identified in plants. All four are given parenterally, typically in combination with other antineoplastic agents in cycles of every 3 to 4 weeks. The major dose limiting toxicities of topoisomerase inhibitors are largely hematologic (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea). While serum enzyme elevations are not uncommon with chemotherapeutic regimens that include topoisomerase inhibitors, clinically apparent liver injury is uncommon. Irinotecan and topotecan are derived from camptothecins, cytotoxic compounds which were initially isolated from the bark of the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata. These agents bind to the DNA-topoisomerase I complex and prevent resealing of the DNA. Accumulation of DNA breaks results in inhibition of DNA replication and cell death. Once the mechanism of toxicity of camptothecins was elucidated, more soluble and less toxic analogues were produced. Irinotecan and topotecan are two camptothecin derivatives currently in use in the United States and are used as adjunctive therapies for advanced colorectal, ovarian and small cell lung cancer.',\n 'Pemetrexed is a parenterally administered folate antagonist and antineoplastic agent, used in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma.

Depending on the tissue specificity and balance of the agonist and antagonist activities, these agents have different clinical effects, different indications and different adverse side effects. Typical indications for SERMS include treatment or prevention of breast cancer (tamoxifen, toremifene, raloxifene), treatment or prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis (raloxifene, bazedoxifene) and amelioration of symptoms of menopause symptoms (ospemifene). Separate documents for the SERMs that are used largely for prevention of cancer, tamoxifen and toremifene, are available in LiverTox.

We report a case of CEL and discuss the differences from non-neoplastic HNCE.',\n 'Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated B cell lymphoproliferative disorders may be seen in patients with angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL). Although both nodal and extranodal sites of involvement have been described, central nervous system involvement by B cell lymphoma following AITL has not previously been documented. We report a first example of such unusual presentation, in which an 80-year-old man developed diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the cerebellum 4 months after the initial diagnosis of AITL. EBV-encoded RNAs were detected in the DLBCL, suggesting that EBV played a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of high-grade histologic progression of AITL. The patient survived less than 9 months after his initial diagnosis of AITL. We believe that this case expands the spectrum of extranodal manifestation of EBV-positive B cell lymphoma associated with AITL and illustrates the importance of recognition of this association when encountering unusual central nervous system lesions in patients with known AITL.',\n 'Familial clustering of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and increased risk of developing disease among the siblings has been reported earlier. Usually familial lymphoma in sibling pairs occurs in the pairs of either non-Hodgkin lymphoma or HL. In the familial HL, same type of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is responsible in the affected family members. There are also some studies stating \"Killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor (KIR)\" genotypes can be important in the etiology of familial HL. Here we report two siblings; one with Non-Hodgkin and the other with Hodgkin lymphoma which showed Epstein-Barr virus encoded small RNAs positivity in the tumor tissues. We have also found that their HLA genotypes are same with each other. In addition, we have discussed familial lymphoma pathogenesis and HLA haplotypes.',\n \"Post-treatment evaluations by CT/MRI (based on the International Working Group/Cotswolds meeting guidelines) and PET (based on Revised Response Criteria), were examined in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with malignant lymphoma (ML).\\n79 patients, undergoing CT/MRI for the examination of suspected lesions and whole-body PET/CT before and after therapy, were included in the study during April 2007-January 2013. The relationship between post-treatment evaluations (CT/MRI and PET) and PFS during the follow-up period was examined, using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The patients were grouped according to the histological type into Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and other histological types. The association between post-treatment evaluations (PET or PET combined with CT/MRI) and PFS was examined separately. Moreover, the relationship between disease recurrence and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor, lactic dehydrogenase, and C-reactive protein levels was evaluated before and after the treatment.\\nPatients with incomplete remission on both CT/MRI and PET had a significantly shorter PFS, compared to patients with complete remission on both CT/MRI and PET and those exhibiting incomplete remission on CT/MRI and complete remission on PET (P<0.001). Post-treatment PET evaluations were strongly correlated with patient outcomes in cases with HL or DLBCL (P<0.01) and other histological types (P<0.001). In patients with HL or DLBCL, incomplete remission on both CT/MRI and PET was associated with a significantly shorter PFS, compared to patients with complete remission on both CT/MRI and PET (P<0.05) and those showing incomplete remission on CT/MRI and complete remission on PET (P<0.01). In patients with other histological types, incomplete remission on both CT/MRI and PET was associated with a significantly shorter PFS, compared to cases with complete remission on both CT/MRI and PET (P<0.001). None of the serum parameters differed significantly between recurrent and non-recurrent cases.\\nPost-treatment PET evaluations were well correlated with the outcomes of patients with ML, exhibiting FDG uptake. Among patients with HL or DLBCL, a post-treatment complete remission on PET was predictive of a relatively long PFS. For predicting the prognosis of patients with other histological types, a combination of CT/MRI and PET, rather than PET alone, is recommended.\",\n 'Tonsillar lymphoma usually presents as unilateral or bilateral enlargement or as an ulcerative or fungating lesions. Most lymphomas that involve the tonsils are diffuse large B-cell lymphomas and primary low grade lymphomas are exceptional. We report a case of primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) affecting tonsils with interfollicular pattern of infiltration in a 54-year-old female who clinically presented with bilateral tonsillar enlargement, sore throat, dysphagia and respiratory difficulty, unresponsive to the conservative treatment. To the best of our knowledge, till date only six cases of CLL/SLL infiltrating tonsils have been reported in the English literature, three of these were known cases of CLL/SLL prior to tonsillectomy. In the present case diagnosis of CLL/SLL was first time established on tonsillar histomorphology and that too with an unusual interfollicular pattern of infiltration. ',\n 'Primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL) is a rare malignancy with an aggressive clinical course. It is usually considered as a subset of primary central nervous system lymphoma.

Local and systemic treatment is needed to achieve CR, but the relapse rate remains very high.',\n 'Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare aggressive neoplasm characterized by diffuse proliferation of large neoplastic cells with plasma cell immunophenotype. Cell of origin of PBL is believed to be a postgerminal center B-lymphocyte or plasmablast. The malignant cells in PBL usually do not express CD20 (B cell marker) but do express markers of plasmacytic differentiation, such as CD38, CD138, or MUM1/IRF4, akin to plasma cell myeloma (PCM). PBL though originally described in the oral cavity, has now been found to occur in extraoral locations as well. Small intestine as a site of PBL has been described very rarely. PBL remains a diagnostic challenge given its overlapping morphologic and immunophenotypic features with other high grade lymphomas and PCM. We report a rare case of PBL of small intestine in a 48\\xa0years old HIV infected male patient. To the best of our knowledge this represents sixth case in the literature described in this location. An unusual rare pattern of CD138 positivity by IHC is also reported along with extensive review of literature of PBL in extraoral locations. ',\n 'Lymphomas with subtle patterns in the marrow can be a diagnostic challenge, unless a high index of suspicion is maintained.

Further correlation studies were performed with the gene expression in the circulating blood and tumor tissue. MTT assay as used to determine BAFF's role on lymphoma cell proliferation. Western blot was employed to determine protein expression after BAFF stimulation. The mRNA expression of BAFF, BAFF-R, Bcl-xL, and RIPK2 in the circulating blood of the resistant group was higher than that of the non-resistant group, which was statistically significant. The mRNA expression of the target genes was positively correlated. The mRNA expression was positively correlated with disease progression, which was statistically significant. The Bcl-xL mRNA expression in the resistant group was relatively higher than that in the non-resistant group, which was also statistically significant. However, the mRNA expression of other genes only showed increased tendency compared with non-resistant group. There was no significant change between target genes in different tumor tissues. With increased BAFF concentration and prolonged exposure, the proliferation of the tumor cells increased significantly, which was statistically significant. Western blot showed the expression of BAFF, BAFF-R, Bcl-xL, and RIPK2 all increased with increased BAFF concentration, which was also statistically significant.

The approval is limited to third- and fourth-line therapy. The appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) specified by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) is the individual therapy assigned by the treating physician, particularly treatment containing bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, ifosfamide, methotrexate, mitoxantrone, rituximab, trofosfamide, vinblastine, vincristine, or vindesine, provided that prior therapy allows further treatment with these drugs, and under consideration of the respective German approval status and the approved dosages. The company cited the ACT specified by the G-BA, but did not state explicitly whether it concurred with this specification. On the basis of the study called PIX301, presented by the company for a direct comparison, it became clear that the company deviated from the G-BA's specifications. This deviation particularly concerns the approval status of the comparator therapy. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) PIX301 compared pixantrone monotherapy with the individual monotherapy specified by the investigator, using one of 7 antineoplastic drugs specified in the protocol, in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) who had received at least 2 prior chemotherapeutic treatments (total population of 140 patients). The study included patients with both T-cell NHL and B-cell NHL, and patients with subsequent treatments after fourth-line therapy. Pixantrone, however, is only approved for the treatment of B-cell NHL in third- and fourth-line therapy. In its dossier, the company therefore presented an analysis of those patients for whom pixantrone is approved (subpopulation of 99 patients; pixantrone group: 50 patients; comparator treatment group: 49 patients). 4 of the 7 possible comparator therapies specified in the protocol of the study PIX301 comprise NHL in their approved therapeutic indication in Germany (etoposide, ifosfamide, mitoxantrone, and rituximab). In its dossier, the company therefore presented a further evaluation of the subpopulation for whom pixantrone is approved, considering only those patients in the comparator group who had received one of the 4 substances mentioned (subpopulation: 73 patients; pixantrone group: 50 patients; comparator treatment group: 23 patients). Only 2 of these 4 drugs are approved for monotherapy in NHL, however (mitoxantrone and rituximab). In the study PIX301, rituximab was not used in any patients, mitoxantrone was only used in of 4 patients in the total population. Hence the vast majority of patients in the comparator arm, both of the entire study PIX301 and of the subpopulation described above, were not treated according to the German approval status. According to the G-BA's specification on the ACT, however, the German approval status including the approved dosages is to be considered for the treatments chosen in the comparator group. Compliance with the approval status constitutes a necessary precondition for the ACT, pursuant to the G-BA's code of procedure. This precondition (benefit assessment strictly within the German approval status) does not inevitably mean that studies in which patients were treated outside the valid approval status are not relevant for the assessment.

Dysgammaglobulinemia. Lymphoproliferative disease (malignant lymphoma). XLP2 is most often characterized by HLH (often associated with EBV), dysgammaglobulinemia, and inflammatory bowel disease. HLH resulting from EBV infection is associated with an unregulated and exaggerated immune response with widespread proliferation of cytotoxic T cells, EBV-infected B cells, and macrophages. Dysgammaglobulinemia is typically hypogammaglobulinemia of one or more immunoglobulin subclasses.

The aim of this study was to analyze a series of patients with \"potentially resectable\" stage IIIA-pathologically proven N2 (pN2) NSCLC undergoing induction chemotherapy followed by surgery to evaluate their long-term outcomes and to identify prognostic factors. Out of 287 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy for NSCLC with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement pathologically proven, we retrospectively evaluated 141 (49%) patients with no clinical evidence of progression after induction chemotherapy and candidates for surgery. Most of them (73%) underwent at least 3 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to plot survival and the log-rank test to assess the survival difference between groups. Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 15 (10.6%) patients underwent explorative thoracotomy; 126 patients underwent surgical anatomical resection after a median 27 days (range: 21-30) from the last cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 113 (89.7%) patients had a radical resection. A total of 22 (17.5%) patients had a complete pathologic lymph node downstaging (pN0), and 8 (6.3%) patients had a complete pathological response (pT0N0). The median overall survival was 24 months, with a 5-year overall survival of 30%. At multivariable analysis, downstaging and number of cycles of chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors (P = 0.006); downstaging benefit was mostly because of complete pathological response (hazards ratio = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07-0.76). In conclusion, more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and pathological downstaging could significantly improve 5-year survival in selected patients with \"potentially resectable\" pathologically proven N2 disease.',\n 'Lung cancer is the most common cause of malignant pleural effusions (MPEs). For patients with lung cancer and MPE, median survival is only 3-4 months.

The study aimed to explore (1) the embodied meaning of illness in patients with operable lung cancer during treatment to 4\\xa0months after surgery and (2) patterns of change over time that may affect the patients' daily lives. Twenty patients referred for lung cancer surgery were interviewed three times, corresponding to potential critical transition points following surgery: hospitalisation; hospital-to-home transition; and resumption of daily life activities. Data collection, analysis and interpretation followed a phenomenological hermeneutical approach inspired by Ricoeur and the theoretical framework was grounded in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception. The findings reveal the process patients went through in regaining familiarity with their own body after lung cancer treatment. Through the post-operative trajectory the patients' resumption of daily activities involved adjusting to a new awareness of everyday life, physical restrictions and their perception of themselves. The findings are expressed in four sub-themes: (1) perceptions of embodied alterations; (2) transformation of embodied structures in the transition from hospital to home was unexpectedly challenging; (3) embodied perceptions of the intersubjective world; and (4) transforming embodied disruptions into bodily awareness. Patients experienced a smooth treatment trajectory regarding physical consequences of illness and treatment which might be due to the fast-track surgery. Clinicians should be aware of patients' experiences of illness to facilitate patient reconstitution of own identity.\",\n None,\n 'Paclitaxel (PTX) and carboplatin (CBP) are widely used for the combined chemotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the development of multidrug resistance of cancer cells, as well as systemic toxic side effects resulting from nonspecific localization of anticancer drugs to non-tumor areas are major obstacles to the success of chemotherapy in treating cancers.\\nThis study aimed to engineer a prodrug-based nano-drug delivery system for co-encapsulate hydrophilic (CBP) and hydrophobic anti-tumor drugs (PTX). This system was expected to resolve the multidrug resistance cause by single drug, and the dual-drug-loaded liposome was also planned to specifically target the cancer cells without obvious influence on normal cells and tissues.\\nIn this paper, PLGA-PEG-CBP was synthesized by the conjugation between the carboxylic group of PLGA-PEG-COOH and the amino group of CBP. Then, self-assembled nanoparticles for combination delivery of PTX and PLGA-PEG-CBP (PTX/CBP NPs) were prepared by solvent displacement technique. The in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy was assessed in NCL-H460 human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line.\\nPTX/CBP NPs achieved the highest cytotoxic effect among all formulations in vitro, as compared with single drug delivery NPs. In vivo investigation on NSCLC animal models showed that co-delivery of PTX and CBP possessed high tumor-targeting capacity and strong anti-tumor activity.\\nThe PTX/CBP NPs constructed in this research offers an effective strategy for targeted combinational lung cancer therapy.',\n 'EGFR mutation testing is now well established as a means of selecting the optimal first-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, deciding on the correct treatment for EGFR wild-type NSCLC remains a challenge. EGFR fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) testing of gene copy number has been a promising marker, but has provided mixed results despite attempts to standardize the reading and scoring process. The novel ReadMax reading and scoring system focuses on the most aberrant cells, to identify oncogene addiction, rather than taking a representative reading as in the Colorado method. The methodology was developed using historical samples from the TRUST and MERIT studies, followed by re-reading of the samples from the SATURN trial. Analysis of samples using the ReadMax methodology revealed that progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved in patients with ReadMax FISH-positive (RM FISH+) tumours, compared with those whose tumours were not RM FISH+: PFS hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.52 for RM FISH+ versus 0.93 for not RM FISH+; OS HRs were 0.69 and 0.92, respectively. For PFS, HR for RM FISH+ versus not RM FISH+ in the SATURN erlotinib group was 0.53 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.003). The PFS and OS results were also similar in the EGFR wild-type population (PFS HRs were 0.63 and 0.96; OS HRs were 0.61 and 0.84, respectively), although amplification of the EGFR gene in patients with EGFR wild-type disease was not found to be predictive of treatment outcomes, which was unexpected but not unprecedented. KRAS status was not found to affect outcomes. Further experience is required to refine the ReadMax methodology and fully establish its validity and robustness. In conclusion, the ReadMax scoring system to identify patients with EGFR FISH-positive NSCLC is a promising technique, which could improve treatment options and outcomes for patients with advanced NSCLC, in particular for EGFR wild-type tumours.

In this study, we tried to investigate the role of miR-338-3p in NSCLC cells.\\nReal-time polymerase chain reaction was applied to quantify the expression levels of miR-338-3p, as well as EMT-associated molecules in NSCLC cells. Wound healing and transwell assays were performed to evaluate the migration and invasion capacities, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was finally performed to determine the targeting of zinc finger E-box-binding protein 2 (ZEB2) by miR-338-3p.\\nWe found that miR-338-3p was significantly reduced in NSCLC cell lines. Forced expression of miR-338-3p in A549 cells led to the suppression of migration/invasion capacity and inhibition of epithelial markers.

This study was designed to investigate the effect of serum levels of CEA and CYFRA 21-1 before and after surgery on the prognosis of patients with Stage I NSCLC.\\nA retrospective review was performed regarding the medical records and follow-ups of 169 patients with Stage I NSCLC before and after surgery. The patients were divided into three groups based on levels of serum CEA and CYFRA 21-1 before and after surgery: (1) continuously normal-level groups (CEA [NN] and CYFRA 21-1 [NN] groups); (2) declined to normal-level groups (CEA [HN] and CYFRA 21-1 [HN] groups); and (3) continuously high-level groups (CEA [HH] and CYFRA 21-1 [HH] groups). Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method for each group. The Chi-square or Fisher exact test was employed to compare clinical and pathologic factors at the level of P < 0.05. The prognostic factor was evaluated by the Cox proportional hazards model.\\nCompared with the continuously normal-level groups, the CEA [HN] group was significantly correlated to tumor size (P = 0.011), and the CYFRA 21-1 [HN] group was significantly correlated to tumor type and pathological TNM in addition to tumor size. Five-year survivals were significantly lower (P = 0.004) in the CEA [HH] group (67.3%) and the CEA [HN] group (86.5%) than in the CEA [NN] group (85.7%) and were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the CYFRA 21-1 [HH] group (47.2%) and the CYFRA 21-1 [HN] group (70.1%) than in the CYFRA 21-1 [NN] group (90.1%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor size (21-50 mm), CEA [HH], and CYFRA 21-1 [HH] were independent unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), whereas tumor size (21-50 mm), CEA [HH], CYFRA 21-1 [HN], and CYFRA 21-1 [HH] were independent significant prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS).\\nPatients with a persistently high serum CEA or CYFRA 21-1 before and after surgery had shortest OS and PFS. These patients had worst prognosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was likely to improve survival for these patients.',\n 'Nodal mediastinal staging is a crucial part of the diagnostic workup of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for planning optimal treatment. Transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and real-time endobronchial ultrasounds transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are accurate, minimally invasive and safe diagnostic techniques for mediastinal staging. Because of the different accessibility to the mediastinum, they are considered complementary and their combination increases the diagnostic yield as compared with the either alone. Recent studies have shown that endosonography represents the best initial test for invasive mediastinal evaluation in NSCLC. Endoscopic ultrasound (with bronchoscope)-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-B-FNA) is a recently introduced procedure consisting of a transesophageal needle aspiration using an ultrasound bronchoscope. It allows to perform both transbronchial and transesophageal needle sampling with the same instrument, in the same session and by one operator only, thus maximizing time and costs savings. In a recent study Oki et al. randomized 110 patients with hilar/mediastinal adenopathies or lung abnormalities adjoining both the esophagus and the bronchi, to undergo EBUS-TBNA or EUS-FNA performed by pulmonologists with an echobronchoscope. The Authors demonstrated that both procedures provide a high diagnostic yield, without any difference in the number of adverse events and a good comparable tolerance. Nevertheless, the transesophageal approach guaranteed a significantly lower dose of anesthetics and sedatives, a shorter procedural time, fewer oxygen desaturations, a significantly lower cough score and a higher operator satisfaction. In this review our aim was to discuss the findings by Oki et al. in the context of medical literature, highlighting the importance of the EUS-B needle aspiration technique in diagnosing mediastinal and lung lesions, when EBUS-TBNA is deemed less suitable. Finally, we pointed out the importance of interventional pulmonologists being trained to perform mediastinal sampling by the esophageal route, to choose the best solution in every technical and clinical occurence. ',\n 'Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in males for decades, has recently become one of commonest causes for women too. As women delay the start of their family, the co-existence of cancer and pregnancy is increasingly observed. Nevertheless, lung cancer during pregnancy remains a rather uncommon condition with less than 70 cases published in recent years. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is the commonest type accounting for about 85% of all cases. Overall survival rates are low. Chemotherapy and/or targeted treatment have been used with poor outcomes. The disease has been also found to affect the products of conception with no short- or long-term consequences for the neonate. This article is referring to a narrative review of lung cancers diagnosed in pregnant women around the world.

Of these, about 75% have locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Palliative chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients in NSCLC stages IIIB-IV who cannot receive curative treatment and whose performance status is good (PS 0-2). The five-year survival rate for patients in these stages is low at about 1%. Pemetrexed disodium (Alimta®) has marketing authorisation in Norway for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. This health technology assessment (HTA) includes a systematic review of the efficacy and safety of pemetrexed given in addition to best supportive care for the maintenance treatment of patients with NSCLC. It also incorporates an economic evaluation of this intervention compared to a strategy of watchful waiting plus best supportive care.One clinical trial was included in the systematic review, the quality and risk of bias of which was assessed to be moderate and low, respectively. The rate of adverse events associated with pemetrexed was low. In a sub-group analysis of the non-squamous patient population, the pe- metrexed group showed an improved median overall survival compared to the placebo group of 5.2 months (15.5 months vs. 10.3 months, HR 0.70 CI 0.56 to 0.88). The economic analysis was based on a Markov model with a time-horizon of six years. The analysis resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life year and life year gained of approximately NOK 770 000 and NOK 425 000, respectively. Whether maintenance treatment with pemetrexed compared to watchful wait- ing is to be considered cost-effective depends on whether the threshold of NOK 500 000 is applied to QALYs gained, in which case it most likely is not, or life years gained, in which case it most likely is.

The aim of this study was to analyze a series of patients with \"potentially resectable\" stage IIIA-pathologically proven N2 (pN2) NSCLC undergoing induction chemotherapy followed by surgery to evaluate their long-term outcomes and to identify prognostic factors. Out of 287 patients who underwent induction chemotherapy for NSCLC with ipsilateral mediastinal lymph node involvement pathologically proven, we retrospectively evaluated 141 (49%) patients with no clinical evidence of progression after induction chemotherapy and candidates for surgery. Most of them (73%) underwent at least 3 cycles of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to plot survival and the log-rank test to assess the survival difference between groups. Multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 15 (10.6%) patients underwent explorative thoracotomy; 126 patients underwent surgical anatomical resection after a median 27 days (range: 21-30) from the last cycle of chemotherapy. A total of 113 (89.7%) patients had a radical resection. A total of 22 (17.5%) patients had a complete pathologic lymph node downstaging (pN0), and 8 (6.3%) patients had a complete pathological response (pT0N0). The median overall survival was 24 months, with a 5-year overall survival of 30%. At multivariable analysis, downstaging and number of cycles of chemotherapy were independent prognostic factors (P = 0.006); downstaging benefit was mostly because of complete pathological response (hazards ratio = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.07-0.76). In conclusion, more than 3 cycles of chemotherapy and pathological downstaging could significantly improve 5-year survival in selected patients with \"potentially resectable\" pathologically proven N2 disease.',\n 'Gefitinib is a selective tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor used in the therapy of non-small cell lung cancer.

The enzymes create and then repair single stranded nicks in cellular DNA. The nicks allow for the untangling and relaxation of supercoiled double stranded DNA, so that replication can proceed. Once the DNA torsional strain has been relieved, the topoisomerase reseals the relaxed double helix. Topoisomerase activity is particularly increased in rapidly dividing and in cancer cells. It represents an appropriate, but nonselective target for anticancer therapy. Topoisomerase inhibitors in current use in the United States include irinotecan and topotecan, inhibitors of topoisomerase I, and etoposide and teniposide, inhibitors of topoisomerase II. All four agents are semisynthetic analogues of natural toxins that were initially identified in plants. All four are given parenterally, typically in combination with other antineoplastic agents in cycles of every 3 to 4 weeks. The major dose limiting toxicities of topoisomerase inhibitors are largely hematologic (neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia) and gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea). While serum enzyme elevations are not uncommon with chemotherapeutic regimens that include topoisomerase inhibitors, clinically apparent liver injury is uncommon. Irinotecan and topotecan are derived from camptothecins, cytotoxic compounds which were initially isolated from the bark of the Chinese tree, Camptotheca acuminata. These agents bind to the DNA-topoisomerase I complex and prevent resealing of the DNA. Accumulation of DNA breaks results in inhibition of DNA replication and cell death. Once the mechanism of toxicity of camptothecins was elucidated, more soluble and less toxic analogues were produced.

',\n 'Tenosynovial giant cell tumour (TSGCT; synonym, pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS)) is a rare low-grade mesenchymal neoplasm of either intra-articular or extra-articular origin. The etiopathogenesis of TSGCT is still uncertain, but recent studies showed a translocation involving colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) gene in a subset of cases. Histological features mimicking TSGCT can sometimes be encountered in periprosthetic interface membranes. To investigate the frequency and morphologic spectrum of this phenomenon, we conducted a systematic analysis of 477 periprosthetic interface membranes and performed immunohistochemical analysis on a subset of lesions compared to genuine TSGCT. In 26 of 477 periprosthetic membrane samples (5 %), at least some TSGCT-like features were found and 18 cases (4 %) strongly resembled it. Wear particles were detected in 100 % of the TSGCT-like lesions but only in 63.3 % of the whole cohort of periprosthetic membranes (p value <0.001). Immunohistochemistry comparing true TSGCT and TSGCT-like membranes showed similar inflammatory infiltrates with slightly elevated CD3+/CD8+ T lymphocytes and a slightly higher proliferation index in TSGCT samples. In conclusion, TSGCT-like changes in periprosthetic membranes likely represent exuberant fibrohistiocytic inflammatory response induced by wear particles and should be distinguished from genuine (neoplastic) TSGCT. Although TSGCT and TSGCT-like periprosthetic membranes represent different entities, their comparable morphology might reflect analogous morphogenesis.',\n 'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a rare sarcoma-like disorder characterized by synovial lesions proliferation and invasion to articular cartilage for which no effective treatments are available. Imatinib mesylate (IM) is known to exert antitumor activity in some tumors, but its effects on PVNS fibroblast-like synoviocytes (PVNS-FLS) and the specific mechanism involved remain to be established. In the present study, the in vitro effects of IM on cell proliferation and survival rates were investigated in PVNS-FLS. Apoptosis induction was assessed via acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO)/(EB) and Annexin V/PI staining as well as western blotting. The invasion ability of PVNS-FLS was evaluated by Transwell invasion chambers. IM significantly inhibited survival and invasion ability of PVNS-FLS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The drug-treated cell groups exhibited markedly higher apoptosis, which was blocked upon pretreatment with the specific caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK. Expression of cleaved caspase-9 was significantly increased and the Bcl-2 family and caspase-3 were activated following treatment with IM. Our results collectively demonstrated that IM has a strong antiproliferative effect on PVNS-FLS in vitro, attributable to induction of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis in association with activation of caspase-9/-3 and the Bcl-2/Bax family, and exhibits significant inhibition on the invasion ability of PVNS-FLS, suggesting that IM may be useful as a novel treatment of this disease.',\n 'The treatment for giant cell tumors of the tendon sheath is surgical therapy, but surgical recurrence rates were reported to be as high as 50% in some cases. Therefore, complete radical excision of the lesion is the treatment of choice. If the tumor originates from the joint, it is important to perform capsulotomy. Here, the authors report the first case of successful treatment of a localized intra-articular giant cell tumor in the wrist by arthroscopic resection.A 28-year-old right-handed woman visited the clinic because of left wrist ulnar-side pain, which had been aggravated during the previous 15 days. Vague ulnar-side wrist pain had begun 2 years ago. When the authors examined the patient, the wrist showed mild swelling on the volo-ulnar aspect and the distal radioulnar joint, as well as volar joint line tenderness. She showed a positive result on the ulnocarpal stress test and displayed limited range of motion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intra-articular mass with synovitis in the ulnocarpal joint. Wrist arthroscopy was performed using standard portals under regional anesthesia. The arthroscopic findings revealed a large, well-encapsulated, yellow lobulated soft-tissue mass that was attached to the volar side of the ulnocarpal ligament and connected to the extra-articular side. The mass was completely excised piece by piece with a grasping forceps. Histopathologic examination revealed that the lesion was an intra-articular localized form of a tenosynovial giant cell tumor.At 24-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic and had full range of motion in her left wrist, and no recurrence was found in magnetic resonance imaging follow-up evaluations.The authors suggest that the arthroscopic excision of intra-articular giant cell tumors, as in this case, may be an alternative method to open excisions, with many advantages. ',\n 'To give an illustrative overview of Hoffa\\'s fat pad pathology with a radiologic emphasis on the anatomy, on technical considerations, and on imaging differential diagnoses in the context of osteoarthritis (OA) imaging research.\\nA PubMed database search including only English literature and covering a 20 year period was performed. The search was based on but no limited to the query terms \"Hoffa\", \"Hoffa\\'s fat pad\" or \"infrapatellar fat pad (IPFP)\" in combination with \"synovitis\", \"OA\", and \"magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\". The literature search yielded 289 publications that were screened for relevance; additional references were included when these were considered of importance.\\nSeveral anatomic variants and pathologic conditions may be encountered when assessing Hoffa\\'s fat pad including tumors and tumor-like lesions such as osteochondroma, tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) (and pigmented nodular synovitis) and arthrofibrosis, traumatic changes including contusions and anatomic variants such as recesses. The latter may be accountable for differences in cross-sectional area or volume changes over time. Signal changes are commonly used in OA research as surrogate markers for synovitis but are non-specific findings.\\nQuantitative approaches to evaluate 3D parameters of Hoffa\\'s fat pad are increasingly applied and their role in regard to structural progression and clinical manifestations of disease needs to be further elucidated. In applying such approaches, knowledge of the detailed anatomy and potential pitfalls that may be a result of anatomical variants, inflammatory disease manifestations and additional diverse pathologies encountered seems to be paramount.',\n 'To explore the technique of arthroscopic resection of benign tumor in the knee posterior septum and to evaluate its clinical results.\\nBetween June 2008 and June 2012, 12 cases of benign tumor in the knee posterior septum were treated by arthroscopic surgery. There were 8 males and 4 females with an average age of 36.5 years (range, 22-50 years). The average disease duration was 8.4 months (range, 3 months to 2 years). Of 12 cases, there were 2 cases of chronic synovitis, 5 cases of ganglion, 4 cases of tenosynovial giant cell tumor, and 1 case of synovial hemangioma; solitary tumor involved in the knee posterior septum in 10 cases, and in the posterior septum and other part of the knee in 2 cases. All the patients underwent tumor removal under arthroscope with routine anterolateral and anteromedial portal, additional posteromedial portal and/or posterolateral portal. Trans-septal approach was used in 6 cases because the tumors located in the middle of the posterior septum.\\nAll wounds healed by first intention with no complications such as infection, haematoma in the knee, injury of vessels and nerves, deep vein thrombosis, osteofascial compartment syndrome, or cutaneous necrosis. All patients were followed up 12-46 months with an average of 18.5 months. All patients achieved relief of knee pain and improvement of knee movement. The range of motion of the knee was significantly improved from (57.08 ± 12.52) degrees at pre-operation to (120.83 ± 13.95) degrees at last follow-up (t = -12.84, P = 0.00). The visual analogue scale (VAS) score was significantly reduced from 5.00 ± 1.04 at pre-operation to 1.50 ± 0.91 at last follow-up (t = -18.00, P = 0.00). The Lysholm score was significantly improved from 49.50?9.07 at pre-operation to 84.58 ± 6.82 at last follow-up (t = -8.04, P = 0.00).\\nThe benign tumor in the knee posterior septum can be completely resected under arthroscope, and the procedure is minimally invasive and useful to the restore knee function.',\n 'The purpose of this study was to characterize the MRI and thallium-201 ((201)TI) scintigraphy attributes of pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) and giant cell tumours of tendon sheaths (GCTTS). The epidemiology of these uncommon lesions was also assessed and less commonly encountered pathology reported on including multifocality, necrosis and concurrent malignancy.\\nA retrospective single centre review of MRI and (201)TI scintigraphy findings for 83 surgically proven or biopsy-proven consecutive cases of PVNS was undertaken. Radiological findings including lesion size, (201)TI uptake (as a marker of metabolic activity), location, extent and patient demographics were correlated with biopsy and surgical specimen histology. Typical appearances are described, as well as less common imaging manifestations. The study period encompassed all patients presenting or referred to a tertiary bone and soft-tissue tumour referral centre with PVNS or GCTTS between 1 January 2007 and the 1 December 2013.\\nLesions occur most commonly around the knee joint in the fourth decade of life, with younger patients showing a tendency to occur in the hip. Features of PVNS and GTTS include bone erosion, ligamentous and cartilage replacement, muscle infiltration and multifocality. MR signal characteristics were variable but post-contrast enhancement was near-universal. 14 of 83 cases showed no uptake of (201)TI and revealed a statistically significant smaller average axial dimension of 19.8\\u2009mm than lesions displaying active (201)TI uptake of 36.4\\u2009mm, p\\u2009=\\u20090.016. Four lesions demonstrated central necrosis on gross histology, two of each from both the (201)TI-avid and (201)TI-non-avid groups.\\nMR is the imaging modality of choice when considering the diagnosis of these uncommon tumours. (201)TI scintigraphy as a marker of metabolic activity further adds minimal value although small lesions can appear to lack (201)TI avidity.\\nThis article depicts typical imaging findings of PVNS/GCTTS and also a subset of lesions that demonstrate no uptake on metabolic functional imaging, namely smaller sized lesions irrespective of anatomical location. This represents an important departure from previously documented imaging manifestations, whereby an absence of isotope accumulation suggested exclusion of these lesions from the differential diagnosis. These findings have important implications when considering the diagnosis of these uncommon lesions and may be important when interpreting post-treatment response. We suggest that further investigation, for example, with MRI is valuable in order to clarify potential post-treatment response, as well as the use of alternate functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET), to further corroborate these findings.',\n 'Aim. To evaluate soft tissue masses of the hand with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasonography (USG) and to correlate imaging findings with pathological findings. Material and Methods. Thirty-five patients with soft tissue masses of the hand were evaluated with high resolution USG and contrast enhanced MRI of the hand, prospectively over a period of 2.5 years. The radiological diagnosis was then compared with cytology/histopathology. Results. There were a total of 19 (55%) females. The mean age was 27.45 ± 14.7 years. Majority (45%) of cases were heteroechoic. Four cases were predominantly hyperechoic. These were later diagnosed as lipomas. Four cases were anechoic (diagnosed as ganglions). Only four lesions showed hyperintense signal on T1-weighted images. Out of these, 3 were lipomas and one was cavernous haemangioma. Three lesions were hypointense on T2-weighted images. All these lesions were diagnosed as giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath. A correct diagnosis was possible on MRI in 80% of cases (n = 28). Conclusion. MRI provides specific findings for diagnosis of certain soft tissue lesions of the hand. Ultrasonography allows accurate diagnosis of hemangioma/vascular malformations. However, in most conditions, imaging findings are nonspecific and diagnosis rests on pathologic evaluation. ',\n None,\n 'The giant cell tumor of the tendon sheath (GCT-TS) is a benign proliferative synovial tumor manifesting as an intra-articular solitary nodule. When it involves the infrapatellar fat pad it can present acutely as a painful locked knee.\\nA 26-year-old white male presented with a 2-week history of painful locking in his right knee. Clinical examination revealed lack of extension by approximately 20°. To help establish the diagnosis, an MRI scan of the right knee was performed, showing a large (5×4×2 cm), oval, well-circumscribed mass with a low-intensity homogenous signal. The size of the mass prohibited the removal by arthroscopy and we therefore proceeded with an open arthrotomy. Histological examination showed a tendosynovial giant cell tumor of the patella tendon sheath. At the latest follow-up, 2 years postoperatively, there was no local tumor recurrence.\\nThese rare tumorous lesions should be included in the differential diagnosis of painful locking knee, especially in the absence of definite traumatic history.',\n None,\n 'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is a benign tissue proliferation characterized by its hyper-vascularity within the lesion. The true etiology and cell source of this disease entity still remain unclear. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exist in various tissues of human body. However, it has not been clarified whether MSCs could be isolated from tissue of PVNS. Here, we isolated MSCs from PVNS (PVNS-SCs), and by comparing to the MSCs from normal synovium (Syn-SCs) of the same individual, we investigated whether PVNS-SCs differed in the capacity for multi-differentiation and inducing angiogenesis. We first demonstrated that PVNS-SCs existed in the lesion of PVNS of three individuals. Moreover, we showed PVNS-SCs had better osteogenic differentiation potential than Syn-SCs, whereas Syn-SCs had better capacity for adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. By genome-wide analysis of gene expression profile using a complementary DNA microarray and comparing to Syn-SCs, we identified in PVNS-SCs a distinct gene expression profile characterized by up-regulation of genes involved in angiogenesis. In vitro and in vivo studies further confirmed that PVNS-SCs had better capacities for promoting angiogenesis. In summary, the identification of PVNS-SCs in PVNS tissue and their distinct angiogenic potential may help elucidate the underlying etiology of this disease.',\n 'Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) is normally treated by arthroscopic or open surgical excision. We present our initial experience with radiofrequency thermo-ablation (RF ablation) of PVNS located in an inaccessible location in the knee.\\nReview of all patients with histologically proven PVNS treated with RF ablation and with at least 2-year follow-up.\\nThree patients met inclusion criteria and were treated with RF ablation. Two of the patients were treated successfully by one ablation procedure. One of the three patients had a recurrence which was also treated successfully by repeat RF ablation. There were no complications and all patients returned to their previous occupations following RF ablation.\\nIn this study we demonstrated the feasibility of performing RF ablation to treat PVNS in relatively inaccessible locations with curative intent. We have also discussed various post-ablation imaging appearances which can confound the assessment for residual/recurrent disease.',\n 'To investigate clinical characteristics and pathological changes of tissue surrounding prosthesis after hip and knee arthroplasty.\\nA total of 67 patients receiving hip and knee arthroplasty were included in the study and pathological changes of the revision specimens were evaluated by microscopic examination.\\nOf 67 patients, there were 25 males and 42 females (ratio of 0.6) with a mean age of 64 years. There were 42 cases of revision hip prosthesis and 25 cases of knee prosthesis. The primary causes for the revision varied, including 20 cases of infection (29.9%, within 3 months in 9 cases,3 to 24 months in 3 cases and over 24 months in 8 cases), 14 cases of pain (20.9%), 13 cases of loosening of the prosthesis (19:4%), 9 cases of joint stiffness (13.4%), 8 cases of prosthetic dislocation (11.9%), and 3 cases of prosthesis fracture (4.5%). Pathological findings in the tissue surrounding the prostheses included debris reaction, histiocytes, acute inflammatory, chronic non-specific inflammation, pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), \"pseudomembranous\", calcification, necrosis, sequestrum, etc. These histological changes were frequently admixed.\\nVarious reasons may lead to hip and knee revision arthroplasty. The main pathological findings include infection, debris granulomas, chronic non-specific inflammatory changes, PVNS. The surgical pathology of the prosthesis provids guidances for clinical treatment and basic research.',\n 'Giant cell tumor (GCT) of tendon sheath is a localized form of tenosynovial GCT, which preferentially affects the joints of hands and feet. Chondroid metaplasia is a rare phenomenon in tenosynovial GCT either in localized or diffuse types. The current case investigates the cytological and histopathological features of chondroid GCT of tendon sheath in a 22-year-old female presenting with wrist swelling. ',\n 'Solitary extramedullary plasmacytomas are rare, discrete mass of neoplastic monoclonal plasma cells in the soft tissue with no evidence of multiple myeloma. They constitute 3\\xa0% of all plasma cell tumors and less than 1\\xa0% of head and neck malignancies. A 43\\xa0year old lady presented to our clinic with complains of diplopia and headache for 4\\xa0weeks. Computed Tomography scan showed a mass lesion in the sphenoid sinus eroding the sinus floor, right wall, basisphenoid and parasellar area. A biopsy of the mass reported as plasmacytoma. Systemic examination revealed no evidence of dissemination of the disease confirming the diagnosis of a solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma. The patient was subjected to 25 fractions of radiotherapy. Here, we report a rare case of solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the sphenoid sinus.',\n \"Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) remains recommended treatment in the first remission in multiple myeloma (MM). In earlier research it has been suggested that there is an influence of the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26) on both the homing and lymphocyte reconstitution after AHSCT. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of transplanted cells CD26+ on the haematopoietic recovery and lymphocyte reconstitution after AHSCT in MM. Forty eight patients with MM underwent AHSCT in our centre. Number of all CD26+ cells, CD26+ lymphocytes, CD26+ monocytes and CD26+ and CD34+ cells were measured in the harvested material. Number of lymphocyte's subpopulations (all lymphocytes CD3+, helpers, suppressors, natural killer (NK), cytotoxic NK and lymphocytes B) were measured in peripheral blood during regeneration after AHSCT. In both flow cytometry was used. On the basis of the analysis there was, as regards regeneration of haematopoietic cells after AHSCT, it was shown that a higher number of monocytes CD26+ improves the reconstitution of helper, suppressor and NK lymphocytes. A higher number of transplanted CD26+ lymphocytes accelerates the reconstitution of NK lymphocytes, whereas a higher number of all the cells CD26+ has a positive impact on the regeneration of cytotoxic NK lymphocytes.

Amyloid arthropathy is a very rare condition that may be associated with multiple myeloma. It presented in our patient as soft tissue masses around joints and eroding into adjacent bones. We found it to be hypermetabolic on fused positron emission tomography and computed tomographic scanning.',\n 'Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease of the geriatric population with a median age at diagnosis of 69\\xa0years but most clinicians consider performance status and comorbidities rather than chronological age in determining prognosis and treatment. The purpose of this study was to assess whether and which comorbidity indices predict survival in a real life population of MM. We calculated Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), age combined Charlson index (CCI-age), Hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index (HCT-SCI) and Freiburger comorbidity index (FCI) retrospectively for 66 MM patients and compared their impact on treatment responses and overall survival (OS). Treatment response was significantly worse in groups with high CCI, CCI-age, HCT-SCI scales (',\n 'Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), a benign condition, is usually observed in patients with hematologic disorders. We report the first case of mass-forming EMH detected on a 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan in a patient with multiple myeloma (MM).\\nA 58-year-old woman underwent workup for bicytopenia, and was diagnosed with MM based on the results of bone marrow aspiration and serum protein electrophoresis. An 18F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed a paravertebral mass with mild FDG avidity, suggesting a tumorous condition.\\nBiopsy was performed to exclude malignancy and the mass was eventually confirmed as EMH.\\nDifferential diagnosis of a mildly FDG-avid paravertebral mass in MM should include EMH.',\n 'Scleromyxedema is an uncommon connective tissue disease characterized by mucin deposits, fibrosis, and proliferation of fibroblasts in the dermis. Although it shares similar sclerodermoid features, it is a different clinical entity than scleroderma. A monoclonal gammopathy is almost always present; however, progression to multiple myeloma is rare. It may have many systemic manifestations, of which the most notable being the dermato-neuro syndrome because of its rarity and potential fatal outcome. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman with scleromyxedema in whom the dermato-neuro syndrome developed.',\n 'Plasmacytoma is an uncommon malignant tumor originating either from plasma cells located in the bone marrow also known as the solitary bone plasmacytoma, or from plasma cells located outside the bone, for e.g. in mucosal surfaces, referred to as the extramedullary plasmacytoma also called the solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma. Both, solitary as well as extramedullary bone plasmacytomas may, particularly in later stages, be accompanied by other osteolytic bone lesions (multifocal bone involvement) and features such as anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal impairment attributable to and indicative of progression to multiple myeloma. These three distinct disorders together comprise the plasma cell neoplasms and essentially represent a continuum of related disease processes. Extramedullary and solitary bone plasmacytomas of the head and neck region are extremely uncommon, and amongst them plasmacytoma of the maxilla is extremely rare. Such a case is being reported here for its rarity. Also, it was associated with multifocal skeletal involvement, making a correct categorization difficult as well as imperative in order to institute the correct treatment. Radiotherapy is considered to be the treatment of choice of plasmacytoma, with adjuvant chemotherapy for multi focal involvement. Surgery is usually limited to biopsy and excision of any residual disease following radiotherapy. The case presented responded extremely well to chemotherapy alone, with a complete resolution of the maxillary tumor, obviating the need for radiotherapy. ',\n 'Monoclonal antibodies are antibodies that have a high degree of specificity (mono-specificity) for an antigen or epitope. Monoclonal antibodies are typically derived from a clonal expansion of antibody producing malignant human plasma cells. The initial monoclonal antibodies were created by fusing spleen cells from an immunized mouse with human or mouse myeloma cells (malignant self-perpetuating antibody producing cells), and selecting out and cloning the hybrid cells (hybridomas) that produced the desired antibody reactivity. These initial monoclonal products were mouse antibodies and were very valuable in laboratory and animal research and diagnostic assays, but were problematic as therapeutic agents because of immune reactions to the foreign mouse protein. Subsequently, production of chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies and means of further “humanizing” them and producing fully human recombinant monoclonal antibodies were developed. The conventions used in nomenclature of monoclonal antibodies indicate whether they are mouse (-omab), chimeric (-ximab), humanized (-zumab) or fully human (-umab). Monoclonal antibodies have broad clinical and experimental medical uses. Many of the initial monoclonal antibodies used in clinical medicine were immunomodulatory agents with activity against specific immune cells, such as CD4 or CD3 lymphocytes, which are important in the pathogenesis of rejection after solid organ transplantation. Subsequently, monoclonal antibodies were prepared against specific cytokines (anti-cytokines), which were believed to play a role in cell and tissue damage in immunologically mediated diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, alkylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, among others. In addition, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies were developed, aimed at blocking or inhibiting the activity of specific enzymes, cell surface transporters or signaling molecules and have been used in cancer chemotherapy and to treat severe viral infections. Use of monoclonal antibodies is currently broadening to therapy of other severe, nonmalignant conditions including asthma, atopic dermatitis, migraine headaches, hypercholesterolemia, osteoporosis and viral or bacterial infections. Thus, the therapeutic monoclonal antibodies do not fall into a single class and have broad therapeutic uses. As of 2018, more than 60 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are approved and in use in the United States. Monoclonal antibodies are generally well tolerated. Because they are large proteins (typically 150-200,000 daltons in size) they require parenteral, often intravenous, administration. Circulating proteins are metabolized by many cells, but particularly by hepatocytes. Proteins undergo hepatic uptake by endocytosis and are either degraded or recycled to the cell surface for secretion. The hepatic metabolism of antibodies often determines their half-life. Proteins are broken down by cellular proteases into small peptides and amino acids that can used to synthesize other proteins. Metabolism of proteins does not generate toxic intermediates and, therefore, monoclonal antibodies are unlikely to induce drug induced liver injury via production of toxic metabolites. On the other hand, the peptides that are generated by the metabolism of the exogenously administered protein may ultimately be presented as foreign epitopes and generate an immune response. In addition, the primary effect of the monoclonal antibody may generate a response, either immune or otherwise, that leads to an immune mediate hepatic injury. Finally, monoclonal antibodies that suppress the immune system may cause reactivation of latent infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis B.',\n 'Carfilzomib is an irreversible proteasome inhibitor and antineoplastic agent that is used in treatment of refractory multiple myeloma.
